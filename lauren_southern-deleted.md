Marxism is clearly the government enforced shut down of small businesses whilst propping up large corporations and expanding the wealth divide.

If I recall I think I mentioned I had gone through similar stuff with the right - and we didn‚Äôt talk about politics beyond that.   I don‚Äôt need to agree with someone politically to see pain.

I just shared hearsay that a mutual had told me - but I have no proof so I shouldn‚Äôt have said it in the first place.  I was just hurt, thought we were on friendly terms - and had a terrible response to feeling hurt.  I apologise for that.

Yeah I actually saw you as a human being and felt bad. Apparently that doesn‚Äôt go the other way.  You were asking around for a job at Rebel Media in 2017.

Which he did, and repeated that he manages getting in contact with personalities for you. He also provided proof - but I‚Äôll avoid screenshots so you can go chat to him. He‚Äôs a nice guy.

Yet the vaccinated can still spread COVID. If this is about preventing outbreaks, one asymptomatic spreader who assumes they're safe & is out & about is far more dangerous than unvaccinated in quarantine.

A lot of these expensive procedures have severely exacerbated the wealth gap and opportunities denied to the working / lower class.

Tests are super efficient as soon as you land. Get sent to a hotel. You can leave the hotel when your results come back negative.    Go to home quarantine with a take home test.  Well done üá®üá¶

The worst part is if you reject it they take that as a personal insult and ensure you‚Äôre punished for it.

You don't need to get this angry about internet politics. People are allowed to grow and mature in their approach without being "frauds". That's a very narrow view.

Trafficking does. The promise of paradise / safety + the shooting of migrants who challenge these people puts it in the very least a gray area of trafficking.

Willing to retract that if a reasonable explanation is given for all this. As pointed out by others ‚Äúconnectivity‚Äù makes little sense.

We also lost 70k views. Obviously we're stoked by the Streisand effect and taking advantage of it, but it was pretty devastating initially.

However purely thinking about economic benefits can be devastating too.   Look at the analysis of New Zealand by liberal prof Clive Hamilton. For temporary economic benefit they lost much control of their country to China.   What sort of long term impacts will that have?

The classical definition of liberal would also be quite the opposite of what you‚Äôve described.  You‚Äôre correct in popular culture definitions though.

My point is I disagree with the notion that out current economy is a totally natural occurring product of human wants / needs at the moment.  I think our wants, needs, demands and the ‚Äúfree‚Äù economy or market itself is being quite manipulated.

Once personhood is established then further discussion of whether ‚Äúmurder‚Äù should be allowed in this case can occur.

I understand that‚Äôs not always a problem in the first world, but this philosophical question even as a hypothetical is fundamental to whether we get to say a fetus (if deemed person) has a right to be cared for.

Whether someone has the right to live off another or not doesn‚Äôt become a real question until personhood is established.  Babies cannot live without care from parents. Is it okay to put them in a dumpster?

You are only responsible for you.  You are correct when it comes to wider belief in our society though. We do see a responsibility towards those who rely on others.

Once viable to survive on its own outside the womb then it wouldn‚Äôt be violating anyone‚Äôs ‚Äúprivate property or resources‚Äù etc.   I know not all libertarians believe this.

They believe in extreme individualism.  It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me for socialists to make the ‚Äúsomeone doesn‚Äôt have a right to live off me‚Äù argument.

I‚Äôd say I‚Äôve been blessed with the experience of life and this child hasn‚Äôt yet so in a ‚Äúhouse on fire‚Äù scenario I‚Äôd save a baby/child first.

Much of the world don't have access to vegan options & would die if they did not hunt.

I simply hoped to counter your implication that I had a deep distaste for the rights of LGBT people, or some sort of personal hatred. Because that is untrue.

It‚Äôs not about force or taking away peoples rights. It‚Äôs a choice.  If you choose to not be apart of it that is up to you.   I have many friends I highly respect who are LGBT.

I don‚Äôt disagree that there are similarities between Islam and Christianity. Not just in text but in modern struggles.  It doesn‚Äôt change my mind about cultural compatibility, but I do understand.

If that touch is of a sexual nature or not.  Jesus Christ himself touched both sexes w/o concern.

It won‚Äôt end well for Islamists (or vice versa).  I‚Äôve never quite understood it tbh. I suppose it‚Äôs just for convenience? Temporary political alliance while the right is critical of expanding Islamism?

She supported a far left group on a campus that had that slogan in one of their initiatives. A slogan I doubt she ever even saw, and something she never said.
