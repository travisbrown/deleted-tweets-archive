I see u at the Capitol.

Let's see how long Kirland Memes here goes without being arrested.  Scrolling through the timeline, did he also instigate the violence and taking hostage at the Aurora Police Department!
* [ 9 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200809171427/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1292509428038729728): Your footage, our footage. Now we know who you are, promoting violence and menacing. We consider your "heckling" in light of events yesterday in Fort Collins, Co. to be violence driven. We will have your full exposé done by the end of the week. Halo, live footage, police records pic.twitter.com/7GT3COLVF0

Never have we published any incriminating content against protesters or rioters, yet they wanted to threaten my team. That is the issue.
* [ 6 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200806223057/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1291501865956507649): No, the individuals are the same. Let's have a looksie shall we?

Furthermore the video shows HER making seriously criminal threats. We can keep digging. We have found no less than 4 desperate occasions that she made physical threats towards our reporter. pic.twitter.com/TXiGWyOY9f

People, and government, put out rewards for information all the time. The images were taken in public, and the content is not private. Sorry, not sorry. $100 for the identity of this woman. We have lots of streams and videos and photos of her. pic.twitter.com/zxVy44ueWU

Thanks for this info though. No "mom" was I'm the vehicle. The big mom took the RTD, the little mom was in a stationwagon thing, etc. We have all the vehicles and plates. It's all public info. Sorry, not reportable.
* [ 6 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200806205503/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1291477498300047360): Sorry plate numbers are not personal. In fact they are public record. Please don't censor free speech.

Also, the chick is responsible for multiple vandalisms. Here's her plate. Her man of the hour threatened to kick  @JoeyCamp2020  butt. Lol. Would he assault a worldwide known photographer? Also, that's her in the tights in this image of rioters. pic.twitter.com/FTq5rj1USg
* [31 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200731101904/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1289034374738898945): This aged well.

* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707143953/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1280499196500549632): You understand that he is playing you. Be will be lawfully ruthless in his response.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707140108/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1280499023410089986): Hope you sleep well at night Karen.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707182207/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1280498960331874305): How'd that work out? You do anything that affects his content distribution?
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707135319/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1280498595565907969): The only way you have proof opposite this, oddly enough, is that the 3 clips of the fog were taken by JoJo and his team. Sure is convenient for you to use his teams footage for your own causes. I don't like him, but you are playing exactly into his hands.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707144351/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1280497725713326081): Nice try trying to spin the narrative to fit your story. Maybe do a little research. Type "Mikki the Mime" into Twitter. I'm a former associate of his, but not him. My mission is to expose him.
* [ 6 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200706131133/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1280126587560697866): Dave Russell with be working for him fr now on.
* [ 6 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200706100650/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1280014093559238657): Can someone help me please. ~Jojo
* [ 6 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200706110419/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1280013943164080128): JoJo has used disguises that tricked even the police. He understands gait patterns, and human behaviour. He has studied the Dynamics of groupings, economics and statistics. He is always 20 moves ahead. He will hire anyone. He has a million dollar settlement that he is hiding. Ugh
* [ 6 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200706094447/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1280013460483518465): They do what JoJo says. JoJo has been paying journalist and investigators and agents for years. There are entire websites dedicated to him. I wouldn't be surprised if this journalist was working with JoJo. The problem is, JoJo has incredible access all while being foul as hell.
* [ 5 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200705213016/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1279888652974190592): Every plate and vehicle was already videographed by Jojo. DenverChannel is the least of your worries. JoJo will be ruthless.
* [ 5 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200705205546/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1279875420691677184): Hi, do I know you?
* [ 5 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200705205936/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1279875241594859520): More. Posted last night. pic.twitter.com/5MxdUxEwp7
* [ 5 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200705204014/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1279873425108897792): "receipts" for what? There is literally nothing that you have that is admissable in court or a law enforcement investigation. JoJo has taken down some of the biggest names in crime worldwide and will draw favor on that if accused now. This chat is real. Note who he is speaking w.
* [ 5 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200705212847/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1279864569310126081): Who do you think tipped Jojo off with copies of internal chats, emails and communications? Why do you think JoJo knew well in advance that Dave was "keeping an eye on him". Why Dave, and not someone else? I've studied Jojo for years, and I know Jojo is working with Dave. Same MO.
* [ 5 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200705204157/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1279863986570305537): Thank u. What you don't know is that JoJo n Dave are collecting content for a massive expose that JoJo is contracted for. This is all optics. JoJo is a master of making the public confused, even the police and government Dave is helping collect content for Jojo's expose contract.
* [ 5 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200705195444/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1279861464698949634): ? What do you mean it isn't true? This lady sent it to me, and she told me she saw Dave and JoJo talking. Hundreds of people are sharing this. Let's keep Dave away from these events to protect the movement.
* [ 5 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200705003528/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1279574051204337665): Leaked chat conversation about Dave Russell (Buffalo Hearts Images) and Joseph Camp (JoJo). It appears Dave works for JoJo somehow and they are collecting info. on peaceful protesters.  #APDOccupation .  @elisabeth  please be careful. pic.twitter.com/SGJwc5xkHA
* [11 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200611005050/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1270881141688434688): RT @JoeyCamp2020: BlackBaby'sMatter.
* [26 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200526021902/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1265098356726136836): Even funnier story, Jay is a punk LOLwyer, but Tom Retzlaff's lawyer has won numerous Supreme Court cases. Things that make you say hmmm.
* [26 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200526023852/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1265097769640964096): But he can call the cops on people for lawful conduct? Extorting people from engaging in lawful conduct? His actions are no different than his enemy except this enemy is relentless, and smart.
* [26 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200526013814/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1265076780001624071): @TayAndersonCO   @DenverPolice   @FBIDenver   @DPSNewsNow . Why is Tay big mad? pic.twitter.com/HOAKNlFrel
* [26 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200526023958/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1265073273265627136): Jeez, I log in one time to see what  @TayAndersonCO  is posting about this shit bird and my timeline is all messed up. LEAVE ME ALONE JOSEPH.
* [26 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200526021222/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1265063349173268482): That's the thing, no one ever knows. And he is tight with social media lawyers who don't release records. Maybe, maybe not, but it's all free advice. Take it or leave it.
* [26 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200526001308/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1265070932974022657): Winning at upholding the law and not the ignorance of some random social media butt hurt office holder.
* [25 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200526054109/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1265069651052113925): A jail cell?
* [25 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200526005037/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1265069408407433217): And don't feed the trolls. It will backfire with this one. Trust me, I learned the hard way, just search "Mikki the Mime, Donald Trump" on Twitter.
* [25 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200526021429/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1265069077070045184): What does this solve? He doesn't care if people talk trash about him. He won't even censor the speech. He welcomes it, then argues that the other person is doing the same thing -which they are. Tay has the ability to censor tweets n posts that are intended to harass but doesn't.
* [25 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200525235639/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1265068387530571776): The definition changes with the public office holder making the form of communication public.  @knightcolumbia  v.  @realDonaldTrump  settled social media conduct and censorship. Elonis v. United States defines harassment as the intent of the speaker -hence clearly marked "satire".
* [25 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200526072257/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1265067577707040768): Not even close to the real truth. This guy has snitched on ISIS members, Proud Boys, Revenge Porn Kingpins, Hackers, child predators, and massive criminals worldwide. When he isn't working on that he is exposing public officials. Don't feed it. It's gonna get worse.
* [25 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200526000801/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1265067154338177024): He will now submit a sunshine request for any calls to incidents and reports made in this incident. He will start websites in Tay's name and ruin everyone associated with Tay. His friends and him will not stop if they perceive that he has been attacked with the law.
* [25 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200525235949/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1265065193064759296): Jay used to be a high profile lawyer until he ran into this guy and his criminal associates. I heard Jay owes his friends thousands and thousands after years of litigation and Jay still hasn't recovered. It's sad that he is doing all this to Tay but it's doubtful it's criminal.
* [25 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200526025718/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1265065853592260608): Yes, but public office holders n public figures have a higher burden of proof in both civil and criminal courts. He never goes near the target of his "satire" and his media credentials protect him under the defamation laws. He's a walking library of information n cites law well.
* [25 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200525235949/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1265065193064759296): Lol. Not even the FBI will stop him. He has a federal attorney on standby and he snitches for the feds I hear so he gets some leeway. Meaner, wealthier, scarier people have failed. He even once had a $500k contract on him by the Proud Boys. Ask how he ruined  @JayLeidermanLaw  .
* [25 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200526005329/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1265064407463350272): I've been dealing with it for 4 years. This guy has ruined multimillionaires using "satire" websites like  http://www.viaviewfiles.net , and others. He must have 1,000 "files" forums ran by his troll friends.
* [25 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200526031508/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1265064039488552960): All his accounts are clearly marked Satire, Parody, etc. and he is well known for "satire" and "parody" which he used against me. Courts have held in Colorado and nationwide that clearly identified parody and satire are more protected because they can't be construed as true.
* [25 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200526021222/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1265063349173268482): He has massive accounts. He is part owner of  @YourAnonNews   and others with over a million followers. Vice publication pays him to run the account.
* [25 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200526044118/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1265062503387709441): Confine or restrain has been defined as even a phone call from the police, detaining a person or straight up arrest for the purposes of this statute. Tay, I'm not against u or him, but he knows the law better than u will ever. He ruined my life and others far wealthier than us.
* [25 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200526044118/https://twitter.com/MikkiVonWeber/status/1265062503387709441): Also sounds like extortion on Tay's part. The use or threatened use of LE to restrain someone from performing a lawful act is extortion under Colorado Revised Statutes. All of his speech is protected first amendment activities, as the DPD has pointed out. pic.twitter.com/lsGIFtX412

All of his speech is protected first amendment activities, as the DPD has pointed out. DPD we now we ask that Tay be charged with extortion. pic.twitter.com/lsGIFtX412

As a woman I want to be just like you. I want to be able to lie, misrepresent facts, pretend that people care enough to grab my ass and run for Senate as a spoiler.
