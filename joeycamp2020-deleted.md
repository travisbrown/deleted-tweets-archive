Each have/had a link on their website where their supporters could go to click through to the fund.
* [ 2 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201202050103/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1333999519701245953): ADDED: If an Fund is longstanding and over it's stated goal, but still being pumped by *influencers* it is almost a sure tell that the *influencer* is being paid a commission.  /done.
* [ 2 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201202044831/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1333996119064420353): When you see a GoFundMe being promoted by a known *influencer* don't immediately take it as something they actually $.upport, or as a charitable cause worth supporting, but also don't discredit it either. When possible donate directly at GoFundMe AND ALWAYS do your research.
* [ 2 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201202044831/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1333996119064420353): Large GoFundMes can continue to raise funds even after they exceed their stated goal. The size of the contributions are often mistakenly equated to the legitimacy of the fund. Again the manipulation. Other factors are timing, controversy, and *influencers* *supporting* the fund.
* [ 2 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201202044831/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1333996119064420353): GoFundMe "experts" recommend "seeding" an account with $50 to get it started -manipulating the user to believe that it is "popular" enough to attract at least that donor. This conduct is actually against many social media policies -such as  auto-retweet bots or buying followers.
* [ 2 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201202044831/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1333996119064420353): This is why you will see multiple *influencers* pumping out shout-outs to specific GoFundMes or a "go to my website and click "donate to xxx". This method of fundraising is completely legal, but is it morally acceptable? Often the funds are being raised by families of deceased.
* [ 2 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201202044713/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1333996118091304960): DID YOU KNOW: High volume GoFundMe creators will sometime pay a commission to *influencers* to raise $$$ for their fund. The means to correctly calculate who influenced the donation is as simple as an Affiliate Marketing link or badge on a specific site that tracks clickthroughs.
* [ 2 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201202042815/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1333990913664634881): Thank you so much. <3

I have no  side-affects. These lolsuits against  @CityofDenver   @DenverPolice  over teargas affects are frivolous money grabs by ambulance chasing scum. Photo: Portland, Ore.

Now I have evidence that an elected official is coordinating a campaign of censorship of political speech. UnFollowerStats..Com is awesome.

If a client is sus, they are shadow banned. The cc. approval must happen before the sale, but HE is just a reseller from Expedia and other sites.......

It took  @Hotel_Engine  2 months to figure out that my onboarding docs were never signed, including the non-disclosure.

I want restorative style justice, and will be the first to advocate for them after I see progress in their conduct. Until then, I stay researching.

My goal isn't to shame or doxx anyone online, it is to have you arrested and put in jail if your conduct is criminal. I have footage from every protest. My team is still fully undiscovered (sorry Foxx you put a black man in danger who's not my team).

I have been researching subversive movements since Anonymous and there is literally nothing or any shaming you can do to hurt or stop me.

You also can't cry foul if I don't call you a *they*. Who knew?

Not for clout, not for attention, not for fame or money. Don't get in my way. I hide nothing, need nothing, and seek noone's approval.

That riot ended /w the building being lit on fire by rioters. Another major instigator (and organizer) of that riot was the same  @AnonyResistance  (aka Edward Dee Dawson) at  #BLM / #Antifa .

* [ 3 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200803192541/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1290368152413646848): No comment. I am 💯 however that at the time of the March there were no police within their ranks.
* [ 3 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200803192304/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1290367410126626818): Oh yeah, I remember. At that time I am 💯 that there were no cops within their ranks. PSL has a history, a long one, of hyping the crowd into a mob and the bouncing before things get heated. Cowards really.
* [ 3 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200803191510/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1290364338004537345): More info please? I've been in Seattle and Portland for the last week so I haven't followed Denver stuff except the Jeep situation.

For example I have Tay's own words at his press conference where he admits to working with the mayor and police. I also have him working alongside domestic terrorist named Candice Bailey and DT group PSL. Birds of a feather.
* [ 3 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200803185654/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1290359145951109124): There is no objective evidence. In fact the passenger's video which I have seen but isn't released tells a whole different story. Mob mentality is borne from domestic terrorists in the cancel culture age online. Can't cancel me though. I come back hard.
* [ 3 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200803185654/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1290359145951109124): If the shoe fits.

* [ 2 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200802032044/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1289762730581217280): It's not. They are however calling him all types of names and making threats in this so-called cancel culture that is affecting them. Regardless, whatever happens I will cover the facts and truth. Tay is a snitch, and a hypocrite and a thug.
* [ 2 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200802031539/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1289760893283241986): Tay is the literal snitch. He even admitted to working with the police.  Every protester is incorrectly demanding charges against the innocent Jeep driver (passenger recorded everything BTW and GPS records show the speed of the vehicle). This is an injustice for personal clout.
* [ 2 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200802030818/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1289759774343442432): You won't find one occasion or charge in which I had a co-defense or conspirator. Thus, no one to snitch on. My criminal history is public record.
* [ 2 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200802031109/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1289759550325657607): I don't talk about the criminal cases or their current standings. In addition to these actual convictions, I have been arrested over 35 times nationwide. My favorite trail was in Missouri for a minor offense. I went to trial and cost the state almost $3m in court costs for a NG.

Also, NY was expunged, CO is still on appeal and will be cleared soon, and I will get a pardon in the feds (I'm pretty sure).

I have a settlement of over $1M in Texas, a $5k in NOLA, and various amounts and injunctions nationwide. My bio says "pro se nightmare" for a reason.
* [ 2 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200802030339/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1289757391081181185): I have already written about this. My article was published about 5 days ago. Essentially if the police declare a lawful protest an unauthorized assembly then the recourse is to disperse and file suit for civil rights violations.
* [ 2 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200802025703/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1289756802813288448): Speech is not a sedative, but if that speech leads to a riot, purposely with words like "burn it down" (Tay Anderson on multiple occasions), then it is not protected speech.  You should learn more about me before thinking I am actually running for office.
* [ 2 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200802025446/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1289756341955776512): Let me help you though. Syder, a case I respect greatly and use regularly, is not a fighting words doctrine case. It is a viewpoint neutuality case. These are two different doctrines. pic.twitter.com/WKjuRo1WF7

You should learn the law.
* [ 2 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200802024939/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1289755036873089026): Incorrect it is often used for those who incite riots. Please do your homework. I am a professional researcher and general jack of all trades, but I know the law very well.
* [ 2 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200802025746/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1289752788214394881): That's not a threats. It's a legal doctrine that explains Tay's responsibility in the distruction even if he didn't break anything, or even present.
* [ 2 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200802024915/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1289752086154895360): "fighting words doctrine". Look it up.

Tay is a lying thug and declared domestic terrorist. ~Jojo https://twitter.com/Joshuajered/status/1266584107087130624

Tay is a lying thug.

The asshat protest organizers are the problem here in Denver. Good to see that indictments are starting against Bailey and others.
* [31 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200731234244/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1289345576442658816): What does any of this mean to me? It's widely available information.

* [31 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200731234053/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1289345221570912256): No one purposely drive into an illegal protest. The road was open for vehicles (not the fault of the driver for not knowing) The vehicle slowed, but the mob started beating his car and shooting. In self defense he drove forward. It is illegal to take over the highway.
* [31 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200731232901/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1289342161922580481): I don't care about the airport except that they lost one of my SD cards, which pisses me off, as I landed this morning. How do you feel that Candace Bailey is about to be charged with terrorist threats and that Tay and Lillian are next?
* [31 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200731223818/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1289329321438584833): Because right now the "protesters" are framing an innocent man. The police can take care of themselves and the protesters can do whatever, but I am focused on the framing of an innocent man.
* [31 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200731223417/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1289328429960028160): You're spinning your wheels on a rabbit hole. Good luck with that.

This is about Tay Anderson, PSL, Elisabeth Epps  @Josie_Riot   want clout and faking injuries and framing people under the guise of "protest". None of these folks cared B4 the attention.
* [31 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200731223101/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1289327636221554689): I have covered the events with the truth. When the cops act up, I point it out, when the protesters act up, I point it out. The truth is what I am getting at. The driver is factually and legally innocent, yet the protesters want their narrative so bad they will let him burn.
* [31 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200731221501/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1289323670851031040): I care about the truth, not any position per se. Personally I agree with the protesters who are doing it for the right reasons. That's no one in Denver because from the beginning all of the organizers here have been snitches and hypocrites. The truth matters regardless.
* [31 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200731220828/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1289321904298274816): I do love how Tay admitted that he was a snitch. The part about being smacked on the head? Dude got a bump. Far worse happens on the front lines where Tay will never be bc he's a b*tch. Inciting then the fetal position with such Oscar winning tears.
* [31 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200731220628/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1289321399413166080): Hi guys, I know that none of you get off the internet so let me bring the world to you.

Pray tell you learn the definition of "stalking" and the legal reasons why I have never engaged in such activities. 1) 3 or more unwelcome contacts 2) conversations mitigate your tears 3) you have a block button, it's on u to use. 4) u reached out to me.

Oh, and the driver of the white truck is about to be charged too. This is soooo fun to watch.
* [30 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200730012851/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1288647538849878016): So, the same applies to the driver. Stop calling for the arrest of the driver sweetepps.
* [30 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200730012742/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1288647293227241472): I think the opposite. The driver was the one that was acting in self defense. You tasteless classless fool. Video, law, and police all confirm this as the driver isn't the one being charged with multiple attempted homicides. Mr. Young needs to for in prison for 20 plus years.
* [30 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200730012254/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1288646141224001536): But you wouldn't. In fact, you would abandon the person as soon as it started or filmed it. I just left the Portland, and I saw what is happening on the street there. You wouldn't last two minutes after the first hit of tear gas.
* [29 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200729205025/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1288577519365496833): Let me explain boundaries. If you, or someone, is engaged in similar conduct you can't cry like a bitch when it is done back in more effective and real world impacting manner. Hence not criminal action. Hence watch your defamatory language misses. I'd have to learn more about u.
* [29 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200729204934/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1288577194386550784): Actually that is counter the fact. A couple of stupid women with a tiny amount of clout cried like bitches because they couldn't intimidate me, and they got their friends to cry too.  Believe me, I am NOT done with any of them. Sad, they can act far worse but cry if done back.
* [29 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200729142053/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1288479115050328064): Lol, wait what? Harassment means something and clearly I haven't done it cause everyone who says I did has snitched and nothing has happened. Clearly you need to understand the first Amendment.
* [28 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200728061345/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1287994524321460224): He had guns pointed at him, being shot at him, if it were me, I'd have hit everyone in my way too. Self defense here is easy. Lillian House has blood on her hands.

The people who should be arrested are the organizers for "fighting words" that hyped a mob, cooperated the entire time with police, then started snitching and crying poor me for their own personal clout. The shooter should also be arrested.
* [27 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200727202857/https://twitter.com/JoeyCamp2020/status/1287847347100086272): Come to Seattle and Portland and see what real protests are like. Where the leaders are not cowards running away.

I'm internet famous.  http://www.facebook.com/campjosepha  or my verified fan page  http://www.facebook.com/joeycamp2020 . What you mean is "back on Twitter" which is a platform I only get info. very little dissemination of content.

Guns were drawn, and pointed at the driver. Of course then the driver sped into the crowd. I would have too. It's not a race thing, the driver wasn't even intending to see a crowd. Bad combo having guns at a march.

The Jeep didn't try to hit anyone initially or ever. Just tried to get away from a murderous and dangerous protester with a gun that he clearly wasn't trained to use. (End).

From all perspectives the Jeep was actually not at fault. The Jeep was missed during the block and thus assumed right away on the highway. Protesters immediately pointed guns at it (1/?)

Can't abolish prison for some but not all. The shooter will be charged, and PSL Denver has blood on their hands. "Fight Words" will be used to arrest protest leaders.
