You don’t have to like gray and black market medical phenomena, but deleting news coverage about it serves no discernible purpose. https://twitter.com/reason/status/1405235987739938820

It was a lot of fun to watch in theaters, our first since the pandemic!  Recommended for horror fans who are looking for something they don’t have to take too seriously.  Chris Rock was actually pretty fun to watch in a horror film. pic.twitter.com/nzOJhboWwH

What you film is yours (or belongs to whoever hired you to film it). Your labor has value.  “PM me and we can discuss credit and a licensing fee” is the right answer.  This case is particularly funny because it’s ABC asking NBC. https://twitter.com/lena_camilletti/status/1378035332516614154

If this is really the issue, may we either:  1) disable embedding  2) Let me re-upload the video with the warning you put on the videos straight in the video.

It is commonly used by people reframing work to deliberately hide its original context, and makes it very hard to find originals.

Different people have different approaches. I get that.  Like personally, I agree with the 2A. I personally agree with some stuff I heard on their side like that.  Commie flags, I absolutely don’t.  But my feelings aren’t relevant to my work.

They were.  If I said "Pete Santilli thinks Ford is leftist" it wouldn't make it me claiming that. I've seen your stuff, I know you know the difference.  We aren't enemies dude, can we take this convo private?

I have made observations throughout the day.  I don't want to publicly argue with you, I PM'ed you. Call me. I'm a free market libertarian. I believe in 1A.  I'm not sure where your claim that I'm a commie came from.

He was an inspiration.   When I studied film at  @AmericanU   @AU_SOC , one professor argued that actors can be seen like paint on the writer/director/editor's canvas.  Heath showed us that acting itself can be art. pic.twitter.com/C17fR0rWdC

They don't directly signify him. However, dc lacking state's rights reports directly to AG. Sessions is arguably responsible, and he's Trump appointed.
