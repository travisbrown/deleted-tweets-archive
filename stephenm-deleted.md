* [16 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210816183426/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1427337945091088387): As France has experienced from its own military misadventures, the picture then becomes complex. Some arrivals don’t assimilate. Others hold more extreme beliefs. Some blame host country for what happened to their home. Sometimes 2nd generation
* [16 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210816183426/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1427337945091088387) ([live](https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1427337943937687554)): Because State Dept does not have ideological screen, and because records will be sparse to non-existent, meaningful security checks will be impossible. Once the diaspora is relocated here, chain migration kicks in as opposed to theoretically more rigorous refugee screening. 6/
* [16 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210816183426/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1427337945091088387) ([live](https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1427337941584695301)): The State Department, using Biden’s debacle as pretext, will try to being as many of the UN-selected refugees to the U.S as possible (instead of regional placement. This will persist for decades. Somali resettlement dominated US refugee program decades after black hawk down. 5/
* [16 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210816183426/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1427337945091088387) ([live](https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1427337940305432576)): It’s now an inevitability, after Biden’s staggeringly incompetent exit, that an exodus will try to leave Afghanistan—eventually millions. Most will have never worked for US government or fought the Taliban. Like Syrians, Somalis, many will end up in regional UN refugee camps.4/

* [16 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210816183426/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1427337945091088387) ([live](https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1427337937981685761)): The states rationale for staying all these years was “fight them over there so we don’t have to fight them over here.” No one ever explained why a better solution wasn’t to deny entry to jihadists or their ideological sympathizers around the world. 2/
* [16 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210816183426/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1427337945091088387) ([live](https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1427337936421404675)): Important context to grasp the gravity of the geopolitical blunder now unfolding: America went to war in Afghanistan after the 9/11 hijackers were awarded U.S. visas by the State Department and then murdered almost 3,000 Americans, felled the Twin Towers & set Pentagon ablaze.1/
* [16 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210816132953/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1427261192532279299): No one in the history of modern politics has Ben more wrong, more often than Joe Biden. https://twitter.com/chadgilmartinca/status/1427260609809113094
* [22 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210722155822/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1418238990419902465): Instead, we have soaring inflation, high unemployment, surging crime, spiraling energy prices, an increasingly unstable Mideast, and a purposefully erased border that is dangerously spreading covid variants throughout the USA.
* [22 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210722155822/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1418238990419902465): On Day, Biden inherited three vaccines, the most secure border in history, growing peace in Mideast, energy independence, and an economy primed to roar. If he had just done nothing & left everything on autopilot, think about how much better off we’d be right now. 1/2 https://twitter.com/housegop/status/1418157120495792140
* [21 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210721013944/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1417660499823665156): Per the report below, in 2020, the lion’s share of Mackenzie Scott Bezos’ “charitable” giving went to “racial equity” organizations.   “Racial equity” is progressive codeword for racial discrimination.   https://theconversation.com/5-takeaways-from-mackenzie-scotts-1-7-billion-in-support-for-social-justice-causes-143659  pic.twitter.com/qo9GfRnKvj
* [18 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210718151548/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1416776790383730689): At bottom, it comes down to this: no family, no society, and no nation can flourish which does love, protect, prioritize and valorize it’s own children. The real tragedy is that this even has to be said. 7/7
* [18 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210718151548/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1416776790383730689) ([live](https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1416776789460983813)): So warped are the priorities of the powerful that, during history’s most devastating border crisis, they are obsessed w/delivering amnesty to illegal migrants who arrived in their teens—even as record-smashing #’s of young illegals (UACs) surge into US (future “Dreamers” all).6/7
* [18 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210718151548/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1416776790383730689) ([live](https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1416776788496289794)): In truth, the honorific of “Dreamer” is the birthright of every American Citizen. But the dreams of young citizens in Baltimore, El Paso, or Pittsburgh are wholly eclipsed in our nat’l narrative by those w/no legal right or claim to the protections & privileges of citizenship.5/7
* [18 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210718151548/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1416776790383730689) ([live](https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1416776786906603526)): Our elites’ worshipful regard for illegal immigrants evinces the moral & civic decay at the highest rungs of social, economic & political power. Future historians will marvel at the inverted loyalties of the ruling class: adulation for illegal youth, apathy for America youth. 4/7
* [18 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210718151548/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1416776790383730689) ([live](https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1416776785958686732)): Perhaps most astonishing is our media, corporate & political establishment’s religious reverence for DACA. Articles read like devotionals—a seeming miracle the US survived 236 years without DACA, or that Americans managed any notable feats w/out “Dreamers” to show us the way. 3/7
* [18 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210718151548/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1416776790383730689) ([live](https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1416776785036025858)): And yet, even then, the judge (wrongly) stayed his ruling & DACA remains in effect, its benefits intact for all current recipients. No such judicial reprieve has yet been extended to the millions of U.S. Citizens suffering under Biden’s illegal border-nullification scheme. 2/7
* [18 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210718151548/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1416776790383730689) ([live](https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1416776784025202691)): A thread on  #DACA . It underscores the vast disparities in our legal system that it took 9 years for DACA—an erasure of immigration law—to be held unlawful, while 45 was instantly enjoined from upholding immigration law (e.g. expedited removal). The imbalance is unsustainable. 1/7
* [11 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210711143415/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1414231500556472327): I’ll be speaking at CPAC today at approx 1225pm. Be sure to check it out — you can watch live here: https://live.conservative.org/

Organize in your communities. Urge your Govs, state AG’s to engage. And ask lawmakers to propose a firm, transparent visa/green cap in the approps bill. Bureaucrats should not be the autocrats of migration.9/9
* [ 1 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210601191321/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1399791805621800960) ([live](https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1399791804527022085)): In short, Biden is planning to bypass fed law to admit as many new people, from as many countries, with the fewest standards, and the fastest route to citizenship. The hopes, dreams, aspirations and rights of those already living here are deemed irrelevant and expendable. 8/9
* [ 1 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210601191321/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1399791805621800960) ([live](https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1399791802195009538)): Nowhere is “elite” beltway opinion more disconnected from the people. Vast majority of voters want the gov’t to approve substantially *fewer* migrants for permanent residency (e.g. much lower than the 1 million yearly average in the 21st century). See Rasmussen chart below. 7/9 pic.twitter.com/ZciP17nQdp
* [ 1 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210601191321/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1399791805621800960) ([live](https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1399791793991004162)): Trump moved heaven & earth to restore integrity, vigilance, vetting & strong enforcement to our visa programs, Biden is doing the exact opposite. We knew our client is the US Citizen and our job was to protect THEM; Biden believes the client is the foreign applicant & the CEO.6/9
* [ 1 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210601191321/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1399791805621800960) ([live](https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1399791792258703361)): None of these policies can be economically, financially, or morally justified. The needs of our communities are placed last, the need of stateless corporations & foreign citizens are placed first. They’re not even bothering with legislation, just lawless unilateral decrees. 5/9
* [ 1 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210601191321/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1399791805621800960) ([live](https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1399791791247925251)): No explanation is offered for how it benefits Americans to make them compete for jobs against new inexpensive workers, to make their kids’ classrooms more crowded, to drain med resources with more insured patients, or to admit those who cannot financially support themselves. 4/9
* [ 1 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210601191321/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1399791805621800960) ([live](https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1399791790216077317)): Unlike illegal aliens, this new workforce imported by State/DHS will be fully authorized to live & work in US w/ a path to citizenship. Green card recipients will become eligible for fed welfare. New workers will be lower-wage, replacing current workers & driving down incomes.3/9
* [ 1 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210601191321/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1399791805621800960) ([live](https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1399791788454559744)): While conservatives have been focused on the border cataclysm, and the sickening destruction of ICE, insufficient attention has been paid to efforts at rapidly importing as much foreign labor (and their relatives) as humanly possible through visa and green card programs. 2/9
* [ 1 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210601191321/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1399791805621800960) ([live](https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1399791787275960323)): As documented in the NYT, Biden is working to systematically eliminate all controls on the issuance of visas, work permits, and green cards. It’s the core of a very deliberate plan to increase all forms of immigration as much and as quickly as possible.1/9 https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/31/us/politics/biden-immigration.html

Almost 180K illegal aliens apprehended in April, smashing records set in March. This doesn’t include tens of thousands of got aways who sneak in without being apprehended. Disaster doesn’t even being to describe it. https://twitter.com/secretsbedard/status/1392259561004933120

The Left’s cultural dominance is unsustainable, but only if challenged in the full light of day.(10/10)
* [ 6 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210406194721/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1379521026808295436): This climate of fear & cancellation makes our country less happy, more divided, and more anxious. These are not the conditions under which a nation thrives. To end this extortion a critical mass of people must speak the truth. Courage is contagious. Change can happen fast. (9/10)
* [ 6 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210406194721/https://twitter.com/StephenM/status/1379521026808295436): Leftwing leaders use defamation, not debate, because they know vast majority of ppl want security, drug-free schools, controls on migration, respect for nuclear family, patriotic education & unifying nat’l identity that rejects all forms of racial division & discrimination(8/10).

So you target the few who speak out, hoping others get the message. This is how extortion works(7/10)

They need to make *examples* out of those who challenge them(6/10)

They figure: I worked hard, I have a family, bills to pay, why risk speaking out?(5/10)

No one ever lost an advertiser, job, contract, speaking gig, or corp board seat for tweeting abt cap gains.(4/10)

People consciously adjust their behavior to avoid reputational slander & professional blacklisting (3/10).

But instead of protection payments it’s CEOs signing letters bashing GA, reporters adopting “progressive” lexicon, institutional surrender to Critical Race Theory, big biz financing BLM, entire subjects (eg biological sex) now off-limits (2/10)

The far-left’s primary political weapon is extortion: the threat that if you don’t confirm you’ll be demonized, defamed, vilely smeared, even expunged. They wrap mafia- like tactics in moralistic language(social justice, equity)to pretend it isn’t a shakedown(1/10)
