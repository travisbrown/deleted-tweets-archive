You could try $5 with free shipping and maybe make a dollar or so. But that doesn't include etsy fees. So maybe $6.

So of course we root for the home team but once we win the championship we have to start again.   Now buy my shitty product.

It will be like Obama but even less criticism will be allowed because she is a Black Woman. And her backers will do to the same to the social justice mvmt  that Obama era media did to the antiwar mvmt.

It would be great if we could actually have a government that acted on behalf of the people but I don't think I'll see that in my lifetime.

When Obama bombed whoever the fvck he wanted the media just hid. I wasn't allowed to condemn him from the left.  I am anti war first so it's hard for me to agree with so many far right weirdos but Susan Rice + media is worse than Bolton imho.

It's strange seeing a more thoughtful anti war position on the right but that's reality in 2021 America.

So I think they probably have an arrangement already for Joe to step down at the first possible opportunity without being obvious.
* [27 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210127010352/https://twitter.com/DreamKerosene/status/1354233563953074184): I actually still believe this can happen in the next 6 months
