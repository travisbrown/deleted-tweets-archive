The character Harley Quinn is blonde and a woman. But she's a hot woman. Very, very much unlike you. Grow up, and get a lawyer for the civil suit, you need one, Alex.
* [30 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210630005025/https://twitter.com/TrumpRussiaHits/status/1410037933336412166): You've built your entire self-worth around the complete myth that you are an attractive woman; let me tell you, you are not. You are ugly. Unpleasant and ugly. It's as much a myth as the perjury you committed in your false TRO hearing on  @PeaceWrite  when denying you're Belle.
* [30 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210630004449/https://twitter.com/TrumpRussiaHits/status/1410036490550267904): You can't be a "Pretty Hate Machine" when you're physically ugly Alexandra, just letting you know. "OOfah Fugly Hate Machine" would be justified.
* [30 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210630003427/https://twitter.com/TrumpRussiaHits/status/1410033858234433541): I mean...THIS BAD and pretends to be Harley Quinn? Even plastic surgery and a metric ton of makeup couldn't fix looks this bad. Ooofah. And after the prison for perjury, you won't even have make-up to mitigate what a minger you are, stalker pic.twitter.com/TAEMe4QLU1

Because in that civil suit your perjury in the TRO when you denied you were Belle is going to come up. Imagine losing all you own in a lawsuit AND being a felon. Can't wait!
* [30 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210630003044/https://twitter.com/TrumpRussiaHits/status/1410032941254725634): So I'm looking forward to testifying against you Alexandra in  @PeaceWrite 's civil suit. Also, you aren't a final boss, you are just an epic minger. What is hilarious is that you think this is attractive? Clue: it's not. You're very ugly, inside as well as out. And a perjurer pic.twitter.com/04piiOOL3W

You‚Äôre now blocked on every account. I will take you back if you ever come to your senses. You can send a friend to my DM‚Äòs if you do.
* [16 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210516142522/https://twitter.com/TrumpRussiaHits/status/1393931120882880515): I would absolutely never allow any person to control my accounts. What makes your actions all the more vicious and petty is that I told you this in direct message the first time you accuse me of letting William Welna control my accounts .
* [16 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210516142110/https://twitter.com/TrumpRussiaHits/status/1393931001282371586): I have tried my level best to remain friends with you, despite your pathetic obsession over William Welna.  I am saddened that that‚Äôs clearly not going to be possible. Your obsession with Welna led you to believe a pro-Trump troll over your friend of many years.
* [16 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210516140952/https://twitter.com/TrumpRussiaHits/status/1393930754439196674): It‚Äôs a total lie. I have NEVER allowed ANYONE to control any account of mine. You don‚Äôt even know this troll  @CharAznable_  who is a friend of Michael Strudalz and Leigh Maibes. You idiot. You believe a pro-Russian troll you‚Äôve never spoken with.

* [ 8 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210509012254/https://twitter.com/TrumpRussiaHits/status/1390983127904948224): In answer to your question, no, I‚Äôm happy for you to do that :)   You lied about Erika, and Eric Garbage is your crush. You lied about Julie, too. I know both were considering suing you at one point... I wonder if they still are. pic.twitter.com/3a1riPTLjC

* [ 8 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210509045057/https://twitter.com/TrumpRussiaHits/status/1390972387315929093): You are not ugly, you are beautiful. Duchess Scabbers and DingoAteMyDignity  are both extremely physically unattractive. Their pathetic attachment to  @EricGarland , on whose behalf they troll you, is entirely because of their huge unattractiveness / thirst / desperation.
* [ 8 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210509012641/https://twitter.com/TrumpRussiaHits/status/1390912285929967620): Exceptionally stupid to make your victim a lawyer.  @DemopJ  participated in that crime too by the way.

You also bleated about  @ProjectLincoln , iirc. Hopefully you‚Äôve noticed how phenomenally well they are doing, and the inordinate amount of money raised. You‚Äôre blocked.

Thrilled to hear she‚Äôs gone to the Feds about you. üëçüèº you set it all up yourself with your mindblowing cruelty. And your anti-American criminal hacking on Russia‚Äôs behalf, of course.  #BlueLeaks

You are shilling for Eric Garbage and against his victims who absolutely ‚Äúreached out‚Äù to you. Presumably because you have a crush on Garbage. You certainly don‚Äôt have a crush on the truth.  #DuchessOfDrama  https://twitter.com/immaculateloo/status/1389802423108079616

They did.

They did. You shut your ears, and backed Garbage instead.
* [ 5 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210505094002/https://twitter.com/TrumpRussiaHits/status/1389877443549450242): Hey  @karolcummins ! Why did you lie when you said "Not one of  @EricGarland 's grooming victims reached out to me personally"?   I'm unblocking you so you can answer. The DMs clearly show  @ImmaculateLoo  reached out to you, before you threw your all friends under the gossip bus.

You women he despises and laughs about as having pathetic crushes on him are the self-deceiving worst. He‚Äôs merciless if a crush-er is older or slightly overweight. He mocks you both on the regular. He‚Äôs an alcoholic

Every time you get close to being interesting you go back to wibble wibble I'm a hatstand and talking junk

You sided with Russia to attack the United States. I know the FBI doesn't see you as a traitor. Damn near to it in my opinion sweetheart. You should be endlessly ashamed, endlessly.

I've never even seen Sarah Smith's accounts discuss you ever. You badly need to stop making stuff up, you know.   Let's talk about FISAs. She had knowledge. Were you tasked to harass her?

Nobody is "pressing charges" because I have not committed any crimes. I know you are a CI. I know Tundra is not one.
* [ 2 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210502173303/https://twitter.com/TrumpRussiaHits/status/1388909246952136705): (most of the talking)  there are three still points in the turning world when it comes to Trump/Russia.   One is Lt. Gen Michael Flynn. One is Julian Assange. And the third is CWA.    @fbiwfo   @US_cybercom   @780thC
* [ 2 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210502173057/https://twitter.com/TrumpRussiaHits/status/1388908701067718656): In the aftermath of our falling out I was looking at CWA and that is exactly why I commissioned you to research as you seemed to know them. All the  #JCrew  bantering with all of them. But now in retrospect it was Gafford and Maibes who were doing the talking. Not you.
* [ 2 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210502172825/https://twitter.com/TrumpRussiaHits/status/1388908107976351744): 3. I associated Gafford and CWA; 4; anybody who attacked any of you was good with me. Somebody showed me, or maybe I Twitter searched even, the handles, and Tundra was ragging on you plural, so the enemy of my enemy became my friend.
* [ 2 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210502172653/https://twitter.com/TrumpRussiaHits/status/1388907756313264129): well, remember how I found Tundra. The sequence of events was: 1. I distrusted, disliked and suspected you. 2. Because Michael Gafford was in your crew and I saw him as a serious cybercriminal, I projected that on to you;
* [ 2 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210502173614/https://twitter.com/TrumpRussiaHits/status/1388910035959521280): Sweetheart I guarantee you you have never met anybody from my crew. When and if any of them carry out intrusions (lawfully, I don't roll with criminals) neither you nor anyone else can detect it.
* [ 2 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210502172112/https://twitter.com/TrumpRussiaHits/status/1388906309014069250): I mean I did not need his endless screenshots poking at the embers of something that was already dead. Negative attention is attention, which was your point. I will say the Citjourno folks all carried on Tundra-ing long after I kicked him to the curb. Maybe not Louise but others
* [ 2 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210502171934/https://twitter.com/TrumpRussiaHits/status/1388905960777867270): I cut the guy off in 2018 but not fast enough, sadly  He and the Lirette trolls (at the time, maybe including you) were equally obsessed with each other and never stopped posting and I saw him as giving the only oxygen to the wider troll gang that my group was giving out.
* [ 2 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210502171804/https://twitter.com/TrumpRussiaHits/status/1388905454470840327): yet the same people, the Duchess of Drama, for example, has defended the woman who is flirting with him over the alleged dying body of his wife, so she doesn't give a damn about the dying wife either. They are all just disgusting human beings and need to be shunned.

His continued relevance only comes from his enemies attacking him. Don't bother.
* [ 2 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210502171409/https://twitter.com/TrumpRussiaHits/status/1388904466313846788): Certainly but few people believe him because of the online flirting. He's either a liar or the most disgusting husband since Henry VIII.  Either way nobody is paying attention to a guy who says FBI agents will "get their doors kicked in" by "real law enforcement" [sic]
* [ 2 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210502171141/https://twitter.com/TrumpRussiaHits/status/1388903900846166034): Let's see the said receipts Mr. Schoenberger, and then let's talk about your connections to Russian intelligence and Mike Flynn.

He doesn't need you and Alexandra Segarra ( @WeaponizedBelle ) on his side, he has done nothing to deserve that. I asked you some questions in German on your  @Zipcle  account, can you answer them? cheers.

* [ 2 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210502163645/https://twitter.com/TrumpRussiaHits/status/1388895058624139265): So as not to be rude we can all see that lunatic  @JimStewartson  is partnering with Lestat.... he blocked me for calling him on it.   Not sure what your friend thinks this adds to the conversation....?

Because not me and not Sarah Smith. We are on the side of the intelligence community not against it. Until last month I had never heard your name. I saw it first from Lia, whom I was looking at re DMS.

* [ 2 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210502161319/https://twitter.com/TrumpRussiaHits/status/1388889182228123652): What relation is the "danger zone" DM room to the "war zone" DM room, then? As Douglass Mackey was in "War Zone". Was that Bannon's channel?

That kind of cruelty is why I no longer let myself even look at what Tundra is ranting about.

Maybe if your "wife" is dying of ALS don't flirt with a woman online. Maybe if a man's wife is dying of ALS, don't flirt with him online.   No names but I am not looking at either of them ever again. I don't believe the "ALS wife" thing, but....

I could conceivably sue Twitter myself for Blake‚Äôs defamation of me as a Russian agent; easy enough to get a subpoena for that (to Twitter). Also there is voice match software out there. No point in a denial of true.
