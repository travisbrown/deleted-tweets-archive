Is it ok to say, don’t think jury convicts, but, if u can’t disarm a juvenile female of a knife without deadly force ur in wrong job. If policy said go fr deadly force as option one? Gotta fix that now

Your point was that a large proportion of American / Brit soldiers were rapists in World War 2 and that’s not correct. The war crimes of the Soviet soldiers included systematic rape but NOT of the greatest generation.

Ozzy did deserve to be the third of the three, but had he been so, he would have won. It’s always math. You made a single error, but suffered from a bitter jury.

Not Steyer he thinks he already has the black vote he might pick Amy, even Warren to counter the billionaire thing, but he won't win. Biden and Bloomberg most likely to ask Kalama to join the ticket.

Also I feel like he picks her before any of the others pick her. Would Amy or Warren pick Kamala, don't think so. Would like  #Khive  thoughts  @blackwomenviews   @KENNYBOO93

This season two 100k and just like  @Rick_Devens  lots of us agree, fav players, and then she picks a third place like normal and gets dragged for that. Elaine and Janet went way further in the game.

She obviously wanted to give Elaine and Janet the money as her fav players. But she thought about it and gave Jamal an “extra” because of his patience and teaching moment   It was a bonus third place she would not normally give https://twitter.com/socalmama/status/1207559926081417216

She clearly complained and production did not think it was ok AND the report says a contestant “witnessed” it you don’t use “witness” over a non-sexual accident
