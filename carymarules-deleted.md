A chunk of it comes from pension funds.   Ironic that people trying to prepare for their future are unwittingly doing so at the expense of others‚Äô present living conditions.

Tax havens are where legal and illegal capitalism meet.

Sure, buy a couple of properties, but you risk drawing attention to yourself.  What to do?

Rent to go up by 600 EUR per month, but he feels trapped because of investing in renovations. Increase is due to ‚Äúmarket increases‚Äù which seem divorced from reality of foot traffic, etc.

Housing needs to be front and centre this election. Ultimately, our government needs to step in and REGULATE.
