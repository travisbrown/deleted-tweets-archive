G-d forbid a million times.   What you've been doing is called tortious interference. In California, tort law will allow TPM to sue you for both Compensatory and Punitive Damages.   Just FYI...

Next thing you’re going to tell me is that the leader of the Taliban has been financing the mortgages of, like, 12 Liberal MPs ;) https://twitter.com/rpoconnor/status/1427399652886949889

If the CBC were defunded completely, we would have almost $1,000 to feed every hungry child in this country.   Let’s  #DefundCBC  and start spending this money on Canada’s future.

What is the NATURE of the future you hope to secure?

Here it seems to have worked, and not for the worst. But, why not acknowledge that? Somebody can be “cancelled” by their peers; the question isn’t whether or not that happens, but the results.
* [ 7 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707175614/https://twitter.com/MatthewAzrieli/status/1412832794452140033): So, there was a widely publicized open letter, for a company with no union protection (insane and insanely funny that there’s no union at CBC, based on what I understand here), but that widely-exercised coercive action played no role in this person losing their gig? Idk man

Yet, I’d be surprised if the government decided to allocate anything in their budget for media literacy to Canadaland.

Who would’ve thought?
