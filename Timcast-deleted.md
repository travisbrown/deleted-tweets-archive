We need more liberals who will stand up for the left without screaming insults, ad-hominem attacks, or accusing conservatives of bad faith  We need to win hearts and minds with reason, dignity, and respect.

The video is tragic and you used it to further your personal politics.  Your video is used to present a scenario that certain people are doing a certain thing which was not depicted.

He is using this footage and setting up a hypothetical to push his opinions on other journalists.  I recommend using footage of the actual "journalists" in question instead of videos like this.

I think it would be great if in the future you didnt use this kind of footage to make push your opinions about other journalists.  Maybe using footage of the people you want to criticize would make more sense but using this footage is an out of context emotional appeal.

Its a direct criticism of you using this footage to support your politics.

These kinds of things are very hard to prove but usually when you dont feel strongly you can win you opt out.   We are talking in circles here. Agree to disagree

Nothing else matters at this point.  The legalities dont matter. I doubt you know more than the team of legal experts at the SPLC

Additionally, it was actually just an archive of the site While he claimed I was in Iran I was in Spain covering protests with anarchists

He would have to harbor no doubts as to its truthfulness
* [15 March 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180330155830/https://twitter.com/timcast/status/974118541879332864): Because presumably the SPLC recognizes that journalists interview people and that all of my public positions are progressive

But it is reaaaaalllly complicated. Pjw was right about some things but I think he overestimated the severity.

How many times do I have to say this?  I speak all the time, I have never signed anything like this.  They are exploiting inexperienced creators.

You can say the contract guarantees a ham sandwich but if its not in the contract words mean nothing.

"safety"  "you wanted sympathy"  non of this actually argues the merits of talking about the contract or the professionalism of the contract

There is a difference between protecting sources and signing an NDA preventing me from producing any content.  Then you have the NCA which is insane.

Or I can say here is why I'm not going.

The NDA prevents you from talking about anything at the event. The safety narrative does not apply here.

If the issue was safety or anonymity than why 3 years? Why not just for the duration of the event?
