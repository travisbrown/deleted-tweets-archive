And if you're consistent, then ok. Personally, I want to see them sunk. That's my position. But I respect reasonable dissent.  But what I won't accept is the lying, and the obfuscation about what KiwiFarms really is.

They have bodies on their record right now. They laugh about their kill count daily and actively try to add too it.   To act like that's not reality is false. And I'm not moralf***ing about it. I'm telling it like it is. Josh Moon is a fraud. pic.twitter.com/fGwQO8IE52

I've lost count of the number of people who have said that about me on there.   So why is he acting like this is some wild and crazy plot, SO EVIL AND UNBELIEVABLE? It's your bread&butter.

Maybe true, maybe not. Seems VERY convenient for him and his site, though, doesn't it? pic.twitter.com/kD14MaO3cs

Ok, I bet $10000 on the height claim. But we know he won't accept that, either.  The point of this all? Josh Moon and Kiwifarms are no credible in the slightest and will *never* back up their bogus claims with any sort of reality pic.twitter.com/OUJC7R3mPK

Allow me to tell some truths.   Him and his wife are stopping me from speaking to Faith because of a personal grudge. This is a baby he didn’t even want to help raise, mind you. He’s garbage. pic.twitter.com/f8aAi8umtc

A lot of people would help you get away from the creep. I have plenty of resources myself.   We'll see what happens. But I want the world to know what this scumbag Vickers is really up to. I'll talk more tomorrow. Sad situation.

I'm not gonna put any out at this point. The reason we haven't is because of the stalkers out there.   But in truth, the person most dangerous to him is his grandfather Matthew Vickers. pic.twitter.com/7FMcKjOWK9

I've seen him every single day since he's been born. His mother Faith sent me pics and kept me updated daily. I've talked to him many times.   Tonight, her parents have apparently confiscated her phone.

It's within the bounds of the law. He's mentioned in the media as an IDF commander, so it's more than a fair question.  Also, this guy implied I was a Nazi. You think I give a fuck about how I frame my points to him?

I don't know of too many Palestinians who are thrilled with Israel's work in the West Bank.  Just asking questions. However, you certainly did call me a Neo-Nazi.

Not surprising, though. Kinda like how he promoted using American soldiers as human meat shields for Israel.

All that counter-signalling...and the media still calls him a racist alt-right troll. They still kick him off Patreon.   Only now, he has a dedicated enemy to his right that he is responsible for cultivating. Self-inflicted wounds.

Well, again, there is one reason. Selfishness.
* [ 9 December 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181209034148/https://twitter.com/TheRalphRetort/status/1071610272362758145): You don't see left-wingers counter-signaling their allies, even the ones who they think are batshit crazy.   Why not? Because they know there's no benefit in doing so. You let those people be the vanguard and only go after them once your main objectives are met.

There was no need to cause the rift in the first place, and it was done for selfish reasons.
* [ 9 December 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181209033703/https://twitter.com/TheRalphRetort/status/1071609070610726913): These guys started up a war with the alt-right that was completely unnecessary. And why did they do it? They wanted to signal to the media and the left that they were like those evil "Nazis."   LOOK AT US, WE FIGHT THE ALT-RIGHT! LET US STAY ON YOUR MAINSTREAM SITES, PLEASE!

Even though the Kumite is already bottom barrel tier, I'm having fun with the fight. There won't be a reason to bring it up after. Oh, I have a new shirt out, btw.

James Allsup lost his Patreon yesterday too, as did  @MMagazineComics . It's not just Sargon. Mine will probably be dead within a month, if I had to guess.

As for Sargon, well, he says one thing here and another thing there. I still don't think he should have lost the Patreon, but that's why I laughed...because he also laughed lol.

Patreon is a leftist org and always has been. They'll keep taking people down. Someone needs to come up with a viable alternative. I don't have the ability, but I'd definitely promote that and help where I could.

Just let em in? There's a lot of problems for people who live here now, without letting in huge migrant caravans. Get on a list & do it the right way if you want in.

Hundreds of thousands (if not over a million) people pouring into Germany alone a couple years back is not what I would call a controlled border. Ours isn't either.

I also make fun of myself for being a felon alcohol enthusiast, a redneck, and joke about everything else you can think of as well. If it's funny, it's funny. There are no sacred cows.

(I actually noted that right after, not before when talking to the reporter.) https://theralphretort.com/washington-post-wrote-recent-run-law-hilarity-ensued-909016/

Second off, it was a guest taking issue with certain historical elements concerning the event, not me. Third off, my Nazism must be pretty well hidden from my Pakistani wife. You're a sped.

I'm just saying, random YouTubers talking shit without any evidence is not much to go on imo. I've seen the same speculation. Not too worried about it as of now. We'll see what happens long-term.

But people have been hating other people since, well, forever. I'm not gonna lose sleep over it or pretend it will end.

The world is full of hate and you haven't done anything to tamp that down with your online presence. So who are you to call anything out lol?
* [ 6 November 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181106082000/https://twitter.com/TheRalphRetort/status/1059721483356958720): I don't support political violence against any creed or race, except in self-defense. I've been very clear on that. If you're asking if I feel bad for risque jokes or content, then no. I do not.

YouTube is responsible for their own chat and user base, not me. And yea, I like a chat where anything goes period. I don't shy away from that stance.
* [ 6 November 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181106080345/https://twitter.com/TheRalphRetort/status/1059717921612722176): I reject that idea that I have done anything antisemitic tbqh.

But banning someone for super chats and chat comments in general is an insane precedent. Tbf you did mention that a little bit, but you were so caught up on Jew jokes and the people who watch the show that you glossed over it.
* [ 6 November 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181106080327/https://twitter.com/TheRalphRetort/status/1059717319033831424): Does he really think we even care about the comment lol? It's his logic. Just a straight up slur, which is fine. But we're bad for jokes about Jews.   OH MUH LOL CHRISTCUCKS THO AMMIRTE

But please don't make a joke about the Jews!  It's pathetic. https://twitter.com/AIU_DevonTracey/status/1059715456330809344

I will disavow porn altogether now, however. I haven't watched any in 6 months or so and it's one of the best decisions I've made. It's a time sink, and some of the convos we've had on the show about who runs it is interesting as well.

Second off, it's not criminal to be a Nazi, even if you were right (which again, you aren't).  Molesting kids is a criminal act.

Thing is, I don't think the fight thing is all that realistic. Doubt Sargon would ever do it, even though he said yes. Jim isn't gonna do it. I just think the St. Jude charity debate would be fun and raise a bunch of money for kids with cancer.

I haven't heard back yet.   In all seriousness, I think it would be cool to raise a bunch of money for kids with cancer. So, I hope he does it. https://twitter.com/JaredBrickey/status/1041707598578425857

Sargon vs Metokur on the  #Killstream , using the Super Chat for Good feature, with 100% of the money going to St. Jude (as YouTube doesn't even take their standard cut, since it's for charity).
* [17 September 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180917143607/https://twitter.com/TheRalphRetort/status/1041697309199937537): YouTube recently put a feature out called Super Chat for Good. You use it on a per-show basis.   My favorite charity is St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Not only do they help kids with cancer, but they're also in my hometown of Memphis, Tennessee.
* [17 September 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180917143443/https://twitter.com/TheRalphRetort/status/1041696947143430144): The channel I am on now is not fully monetized. Super chats is the only way the show makes money. There is no YouTube Premium shekels or ad money, just the super chats.

Obviously, Sargon has resisted coming on the  #Killstream , much less coming on and talking to Metokur. I guess he thinks it will make me money and give me some kind of Sargon seal.

* [12 September 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180912150708/https://twitter.com/TheRalphRetort/status/1039893172644708355): I didn't state that at all, you incorrectly spun that on the basis of my statement. I've been asking about the money for a long while, which is probably why he made those false allegations against me.

Or, he could just delete his Twitter and go away. I suppose that's another option for a scammer.

It's on him to do so. I haven't run any fundraisers for my imaginary bisexual atheist girlfriend.   (Oh, and he made all kinds of baseless claims against me and our Discord server, but I see you ignore that, too.)

It would pretty much kill my show if I went hard with the self-censorship.   It wouldn't be The  #Killstream  anymore.

You can be sure I will post that response.

I logged into the email account itself, and I still have the credentials...which I offered to Vee, and by extension, Sargon himself.   Instead, Sargon made a fraudulent video.

I didn't just pick up some random email. The person who sent it actually gave me the login credentials, which I checked ON-AIR.   I then had the email itself analyzed, and it checked out. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa4JijaDLOs

Gained 40,000 spots in the US since my return about about 100,000 in the worldwide rank. I would also argue that I *am* doing something by publishing posts about how fucked up this is. I don't live in the UK, of course, so I can't go marching.

Props to Nora for getting the post out early and to the rest of the posse (especially  @Zidan_Lianciel ) for getting it out there.
