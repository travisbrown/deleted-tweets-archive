## About the Project 


These tweets display some bad actors most divisive uses of the twitter platform.


Example:

MrAndyNgo has 895K followers. Many are rabid & receive/RT him real-time. They blasts hateful, bigoted sentiment. Andy's targets get harassed, death threats, spun into a news cycle via Post Millennial, or other far-right tabloid. Andy deletes his tweet after a short time. Then he walks away.

We are outraged.

## Methodology

Please note that none of the content linked here or associated with this project was accessed directly from Twitter.
All data was gathered from the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) over several months, via the following steps:

* We choose a set of seed accounts, mostly representing far-right activists associated with .....
* We use the [Wayback Machine's CDX index](https://github.com/internetarchive/wayback/blob/master/wayback-cdx-server/README.md) to list all archived tweet URLs for these accounts.
* We download these archived pages (which are a mix of HTML and JSON) from the Wayback Machine, saving the Wayback Machine's "original" version of each page, together with the Wayback Machine's digest for that page.
* We parse these pages to extract information about individual tweets and Twitter accounts.
* We identify retweets, replies, and other relationships between accounts, and use these relationships to add new accounts to the download queue.
* We repeat these steps with the updated set of accounts.

Most of this process is automated using tools from the [cancel-culture](https://github.com/travisbrown/cancel-culture) project.
