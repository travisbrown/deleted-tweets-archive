* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707042046/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1280356031143477249): While the ADL works behind the scenes with Paypal and other big monopolies to suppress the Free Speech of Americans, they are taking huge sums of money from the government. Here they are listed as taking $5-10 million in COVID-19 relief.   https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/cares-act/assistance-for-small-businesses/sba-paycheck-protection-program-loan-level-data  pic.twitter.com/teiPwvTADZ

* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707034637/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1280347436372889602): Loomer doesn't worry about being cancelled because she can't be. She's always been willing to go further than other alt-lites for her own reasons. If she wins her district, she'll likely be writing legislation alongside the ADL to censor BDS. https://twitter.com/RowdyRamzan/status/1280335527930146816
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707033355/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1280344242863460352): I erroneously had said that  @kenningtonsays  on Loomered dot com ignored the ADL angle, I was wrong about that. I apologize.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707032735/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1280342648134471680): Yes, they did.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707032545/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1280342183623585793): Loomered dot com did in fact mention the ADL, and quotes Striker directly. https://loomered.com/2020/07/06/leaked-images-from-paypal-zoom-meeting-show-anti-right-wing-bias/
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707032204/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1280341258351849473): No. https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1280337159522844677
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707032043/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1280340917291974658): I appreciate that you gave National Justice credit, but why did you leave out that the ADL is controlling who Paypal decides to censor? Why protect the ADL?
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707031459/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1280339474115891200): The word "ADL" doesn't appear even once in this Loomered article. They didn't just copy the story, they scrubbed it of anything that implicates the real culprits behind internet censorship. pic.twitter.com/4Tv7qSuQu2
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707030547/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1280337159522844677): Loomer's site gives National Justice credit, but like Schaffer it sanitizes the Paypal story by not calling out the ADL for being behind the censorship and claims "anti-right wing" bias while tiptoeing around the blatantly anti-White nature of said bias. https://loomered.com/2020/07/06/leaked-images-from-paypal-zoom-meeting-show-anti-right-wing-bias/
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707025118/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1280333516744646656): No. He's afraid the ADL, a Jewish group, will be blamed for censorship rather than liberals, Democrats or "the left."
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707024955/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1280333168755826688): What Schaffer doesn't say:  1. The Jewish ADL and the FBI are behind the censorship. 2. White people are explicitly targeted for racial discrimination.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707024730/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1280332562527858699): Schaffer neglects to mention that the leaked images reveal that the ADL and the FBI are behind the censorship at Paypal. I am willing to pretend to believe that he first saw the images on the Proud Boys Parler, but his refusal to call out the real culprits is inexcusable. https://twitter.com/ElijahSchaffer/status/1280187148919070720
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707023725/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1280330021454917632): I reject this simplistic view of free speech. Free speech is a culture, not just a rule in a book that can be easily skirted. If private companies are allowed by the system to censor, then the establishment will simply make sure all communications are privatized.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707023409/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1280329202567438337): Paypal operates on the internet, which was invented by the US military. So the invention of the internet itself is a massive subsidy to the company, which IMO obligates them to respect the first amendment rights of American citizens.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707023252/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1280328877097828352): "Nothing is stopping people"  STFU. Many things are stopping people. One of them is a web of government regulations designed to reduce competition for big players, something libertarians used to care about. https://twitter.com/DraftyLoft/status/1280212616409997313
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707023020/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1280328238552711168): Muh private company. Lol. STFU dork. No one wants to hear it. https://twitter.com/DraftyLoft/status/1280141670898688000
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707022223/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1280326239337820160): Schaffer says that his source for the Paypal leaks was the Proud Boys Parler. That could be where he saw it first, but hundreds of people have told him the original source by now. It would be good journalistic practice for him to inform his audience of the original source. https://twitter.com/ElijahSchaffer/status/1280297213470691328
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707021922/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1280325481024360450): That could be, but as soon as he was alerted to the source of the original leaks by people in his feed, he could have made it clear where they came from originally.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707021713/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1280324938486996992): At least the article posted here by Elijah Schaeffer that appears on Laura Loomer's website, gives National Justice credit for the Paypal leaks. https://twitter.com/ElijahSchaffer/status/1280314394270994432
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707020709/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1280322407602028544): More likely he doesn't want people reading Striker's article that explicitly calls out the ADL as Jewish and the top censor of the internet.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707020031/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1280320734779318274): This dude stole Striker's and my work from National Justice and gave no attribution. I don't mind that he is repeating the story, but give credit where it's due. https://twitter.com/ElijahSchaffer/status/1280187148919070720
* [ 6 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200706165500/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1280183453179424775): Jews in NY's 4th congressional district grift $1.3 million for phony "security enhancements" to synagogues. https://patch.com/new-york/gardencity/faith-based-organizations-get-federal-security-funding
* [ 4 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200704171222/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1279463047451607046): It's fake.
* [ 4 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200704162400/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1279450874201456640): The conscience of a jew. https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1277969555910868997
* [ 4 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200704161019/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1279447433462910982): pic.twitter.com/7sa8i7JeJv

* [ 4 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200704144629/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1279426335601983488): Jillian Wuestenberg was pregnant and probably more afraid for her unborn child than anything. Liberal Whites don't want to hear this, but punching or kicking a pregnant woman in the stomach is a thing in some black communities. Get mad if you will, but you can't say it's a lie.
* [ 4 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200704144209/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1279425244265156608): Imagine thinking Whites have any desire to be in black people's faces, or any other part of them. These incidents are instigated against Whites minding their own business by black people following media cues. The blacks desperate for social media clout are the hysterical ones. https://twitter.com/Mint_Capri/status/1279277222071799811
* [ 4 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200704111551/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1279373328176865281): Exclusive leaked images from a private PayPal training seminar reveal explicit racial bias against White customers. https://national-justice.com/national-justice-exclusive-leaked-images-paypal-seminar-reveals-explicit-racial-bias-against-white
* [ 4 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200704010421/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1279219437925695488): Document them.

* [ 4 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200704002002/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1279208285258813440): It does feel that way, doesn't it. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/446461592029630464

After seeing what happened to the Wuestenbergs, I agree that the police should be defunded. https://twitter.com/Aarick20/status/1279199124856934401
* [ 3 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200703234631/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1279199850475773952): It would enable whites to defend themselves.

* [ 3 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200703233710/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1279197498008051713): The National Guard isn't there in a red state because everything you've ever believed is a lie, the system hates you and no one in power will ever do anything for you, including Donald Trump. The US government is a cruel joke played on the only people with any respect for it. https://twitter.com/superclearpepsi/status/1279185109149679616
* [ 3 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200703232949/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1279195650320728067): I'm not a liberal. This doesn't apply to me.
* [ 3 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200703232450/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1279194395896619008): You will lose all social status, power and standing right away and put yourself in a place where blacks can pass judgement on you liberals. It's everything You claim to want to do. You have no excuse. Put your privilege where your mouth is. You have to say it.
* [ 3 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200703232030/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1279193304077414406): In fact, any White liberal that refuses to say ni66er is suspect. They are trying to hold on to their systemic power and privilege for no other reason than their own selfishness and moral cowardice. Say it liberals. Put yourself at the mercy of blacks. You have a moral duty.
* [ 3 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200703231754/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1279192648948072453): White shitlibs talk a lot of shit about syrrendering their privilege to blacks, but I don't see much action. There is one act which you can take as a white liberal to eliminate all your privilege and hand it to blacks. Say ni66er. In public. It's your ethical obligation.
* [ 3 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200703230532/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1279189536506077186): If blacks ambush you publicly, put phones in your face and try to Karen you, don't apologize. Ask them how much money they want to leave you alone. When they tell you, just say, "See, I knew it was a fukkin shakedown all along." and walk away.
* [ 3 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200703230012/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1279188195926835202): Every day this is happening multiple times a day. If this man said the n-word I'll eat my hat. But given the way these people behave, he would be more than justified in doing so. https://twitter.com/lhfirm/status/1278400602125611013

* [ 3 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200703225147/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1279186102654504966): You're a conformist, privileged, classist piece of shit that spouts regime ideology and pretends to be rebelious. I can't take a joke because you can't.
* [ 3 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200703223955/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1279183090976526338): The US government said that going to BLM/Antifa riots was safe because "White supremacy" is more dangerous than Covid. Every black person that attended a riot and got COVID should sue the government for lying to them and causing damages. Easy way to get some gibs.
* [ 3 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200703211923/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1279162824913235971): This is why conservatives deserve no respect. https://twitter.com/FDRLST/status/1278715051269029888

That's why his department lets black lives matter and Antifa riot, destroy property and abuse citizens, while releasing the SWAT team on a White guy for an "offensive sticker." https://twitter.com/NorfolkPD/status/1279095843170254848
* [ 3 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200703205624/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1279157038287904774): Literally a sticker.

A guy puts a sticker up and they treat him like Pablo fucking Escobar. This why people can't respect cops. https://twitter.com/NorfolkPD/status/1279095843170254848
* [ 3 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200703205252/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1279156149363904513): Rioting, shootings, violent assaults and vandalism and the police do literally nothing, even as cops themselves are targeted by violent mobs. A guys puts a sticker up and they create a theater show outside his home. This why people can't respect cops. https://twitter.com/NorfolkPD/status/1279095843170254848
* [ 3 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200703193113/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1279135604123611141): The Feds are putting so much pressure on White Americans right now, they're hoping to get some schizo or loner to snap and do the unthinkable. They know Americans are increasingly frustrated with blm and anarchist rioters going unpunished, they need a White villain badly.

It happened in a place where open carry of handguns is legal. And they are still getting railroaded. Where in the US will the government *not* railroad the Whites in this incident?
* [ 3 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200703162654/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1279089218254508033): This incident is as likely to happen in a red state as a blue state. Possibly MORE likely since the establishment will be eager to prove they're not racist. At some point Whites have to actually fight for institutional power. If your ethos is always to run, you'll be chased.
* [ 3 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200703162228/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1279088100279488518): And what do you do when you can't move anymore? The current situation is the result of this sentiment. Rather than vying for power over the institutions Whites in America have always surrendered them to move to greener pastures. All the pastures will be brown eventually. https://twitter.com/Som87855629/status/1278845113809002497

Every white person that is participating in railroading them needs to be named and shamed. We have no institutional support, all we have is numbers. This could be literally anyone. https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1278823794736541696

But if you watched the video, you can see that this particular edit didn't just change the perception, it was literally the opposite of the truth. So as to why it's important, ask Myles Power why he thought it was important to lie.

They're administered at the local level, which is what they are going to change. But I agree that whites should not be policing blacks in black neighborhoods.

We're long past that. The redpill is that every institution in the US is against us with no exceptions and would rather die than protect us. That is what big normie needs to learn from this.

But accomplishing that in a way that preserves the anti-white narrative structure on which US institutions operate and does not look like a win for whites or moralize whites is a challenge, hence total system paralysis.
* [ 1 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200601085644/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1267379517833777153): The United States is structurally anti-white throughout all institutions. This is the reason for the total government surrender to black and anarchist rioters. Institutions in the US would rather burn down or collapse than function in a way that benefits and moralizes whites.

That was plausible 5 days ago, not today. This is something else. Liberal Jews simply don't want to stop it, and the narrative clash has paralyzed the jignats. There is no politically convenient way to restore order.

Trump does not need a domestic terrorism statute to go after antifa. He can use well established organized crime laws. But he won't, this tweet was just electioneering.

Even in a place with no rioting. Then ask them to honestly explain why they wouldn't do it.

This was in reality a massive conspiracy to commit violence and property damage organized by antifa across multiple cities. Where are the Jewish lawyers to sue hem?

Diesel exhaust does however contain high amounts of oxygen. It's very hard to kill people with diesel. Regular gasoline exhaust is more dangerous.

They killed lice with Zyklon B, steam or later with a microwave delousing device. Initial reports of the "gas chambers" at Treblinka said they were steam chambers where they steamed Jews to death. They changed it to diesel after Nuremberg.

I've never seen or heard of it before, but it was probably made either during the war or in the immediate aftermath. It doesn't match up with anything else they tell you about the holocaust though.

The allegation is that they gassed 900,000 Jews with Diesel exhaust from a Soviet tank engine at Treblinka. Is that the euthanasia expertise these people brought to the table?

Lol. Why, if these were super secret exterminations, were the Nazis filming? I can't take anyone seriously that presents this crap.

There is not a single Nazi in the video and there is no reason to think the images of the emaciated men and those of the car with the pipes are in any way connected. They certainly were not filmed with the same camera. Very low effort propaganda. https://twitter.com/kyledavis007/status/1267013742245613569

There are claims of up to 70k killed by euthanasia, but no evidence for this number. That is actually a big number if true, but Jews have cheapened it with claims of 6 million.

On top of that eugenic sterilization is IMO a humane and reasonable policy and was considered to be for most of history. In 1937 a majority of Americans wanted to sterilize criminals.

But that fact works against their narrative, not in favor of it, because by the orthodox story there was no mass death in 1933 so it shows that it's all just hysterical propaganda.

By 1939 he had been Chancellor for 6 years already and the Jews were actively trying to drag the US into a war, and had succeeded in dragging Britain into one. They were definitely smearing him.

I am liking Dalton so far, but I still kind of enjoy the more formal tone of the final Murphy edition. I've never read the Ford version.

It's Murphy's unfinished first draft that was then completed by a non-native English speaker. I prefer Murphy's final translation. Dalton's intro goes through the history of previous English translations and gives his rationale for doing a new one.

Conservatives are now doing this too.

Everyone expects this from blacks. The extent to which various groups pretend they don't depends on their function within the Jewish power system. Those that call it what it is signal they have no place in that system.

Whites and blacks will come into conflict the more we are forced to be integrated. The forced integration is how the conflict is fomented. This fundamental premise is only rarely examined. Pretending this isn't true is just another way of reifying liberalism.

This is almost certainly not the case. A misidentification is a tragedy for the individual, but it's racially irrelevant.

I'm not sticking up for him. Cops killed Daniel Shaver, they sided with antifa in Charlottesville, they look the other way as girls are raped by Pakistanis and Africans in the UK. Cops and blacks deserve each other.

No doubt it had been drawn up beforehand and they were waiting on something to trigger it for political effect. And now he has burned this stunt with six months til the election. Oh well.

The EO will likely be worded so as to not have any teeth though.

Yes, Jews need whites to accept their frame, but it's still their frame. Almost all whites buy into at least some of it. We need to break them from it.

Liberals don't get national health care or a living wage, but they do get immigration. This system of setting whites at each others throats was created by Jewish political consultants.

They won't stand up for you once you are targeted, but again, jews need to have these volunteer spies in the community to rat people out.

The sham is shown for what it is when a group wants to teach against hatred of Palestinians.

Ok, so again we could go into autistic detail about how much fuel that would take and how much ash produced, but leaving that aside, it's basically an unfalsifiable InB4 for anyone that wants to empirically examine the holocaust.

I don't see any indication of a gas chamber. It's much more plausible that's Dario Gabbai peeping.

There is no way to prove date of the "sonnerkommando" photo. There were 44 aerial photos of Auschwitz taken from April 1944 to Jan 1945. How many of them show the smoke?

But even if we grant that it is at Auschwitz, that is the most that can be granted. There is no evidence at all of when, other than sometime prior to 1945.

It either proves nothing or weighs heavily against them. 3rd cope is "the tests were illegal" Ok, but are they wrooooong?

First cope is simply unfalsifiable and leaves us back at square one. No matter what, these results cannot ever be proof of gassings, they are yet another hurdle for hoaxers to leap.

The cope that hoaxers use for this is that not all surfaces are ideal for forming HCN residue and there may be some reason why the "gas chambers" were resistant to forming it. Or they claim the gas chambers have been exposed to the elements.

Hoaxers don't claim the numbers are fake.

Rudolf's wasn't, but his interpretation was. All but Markiewicz are skeptics. Markiewicz was an official Polish government test. He used a different testing method and found no HCN residue anywhere. You can speculate as to why.

See how many kids sign up. https://twitter.com/ADL/status/1260710611832451077

Why bother blaming Christian Zionists? Fact is, they know it's a sore spot. I want to press on that sore spot.
* [13 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513233515/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1260715233561231362): In reality breaking down Jewish power from a relatively weak position means undermining their moral authority. And the Palestine issue absolutely does that. Which is why they try to blames whites, Christians or anyone else for it when you bring it up.

Israel can't exist without that institutional power. A hypothetical situation where we could send Jews to Israel would already mean we can dictate to them. So if we're larping, why not Siberia?

Jews can go to Israel now if they wish. Israel needs diaspora Jews influencing finance, politics and media in the west in order to exist. And we oppose such influence.

That alone is not all that impressive. Objectively ISIS has only benefited Israel while being disastrous for other Arabs and for Europe.

They absolutely do not want secular nationalism, which is historically what the Palestine movement has been.
* [13 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513224847/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1260703539980046338): This is overthinking it. The idea that there must be some kind of consistent support for subjugating people rather than taking the side most beneficial to you in a conflict is weird. IMO this is just some kind of autism trap.

* [13 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513224121/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1260701669299572737): It makes no sense to fight against Zionist foreign policy on every front but this one. The Zionist project is a package deal. It requires starting conflicts, taking out cohesive neighboring states, creating mass refugee flows into Europe and stealing the land of other people.
* [13 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513223349/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1260699772693946368): Palestinians are nationalists too. They are fighting against being conquered by invading immigrants.
* [13 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513223247/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1260699514631004160): That's basically it. Palestinians have a human case. The jewish case is weak, it reveals their utter hypocrisy and it costs them money, time and prestige. It doesn't hurt whites in any way or hurt advocacy on behalf of whites to talk about this.
* [13 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513222959/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1260698807848837126): The Palestine issue is a weak point for Jewish power. Europeans don't like it. The majority of Europe has for years sympathized more with Palestinians. Working against BDS takes up a lot of Jewish time and effort and money. Why should they have an easy time of things?
* [13 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513222653/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1260698029704839168): But in general what Jews are doing to Palestinians is immoral. So why shouldn't I say so? What they are doing in the West is immoral, and what they are doing in Palestine is also immoral. I am going to talk about bad things they do. I don't have to love Palestinians to do that.
* [13 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513222551/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1260697770861748226): But in general what Jews are doing to Palestinians is immoral.

If for no other reason, you should support the right of white Americans to *not* do business with Israel if they choose not to.
* [13 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513222026/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1260696407251595265): BDS was the best thing to come out of the leftist Palestine movement in recent years. When I left such circles years ago, BDS was only being talked about. Now there are laws against it. So at some point they did put a scare into Jews. Everyone should support BDS.
* [13 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513221918/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1260696121778864128): They even used to make a show of some kind of Jewish Arab unity against "white supremacy" that doesn't exist anywhere other than among the privileged layer of anti-white campus activists. All of that is political theater and it's despicable. And it doesn't help Arabs.
* [13 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513221449/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1260694993938911238): This is by design. They redirect anger over Palestine into SJW politics and anti-whiteness. Palestine groups in the US are usually Jews or butt goy Arabs telling people it's the fault of white people or oil companies or Christian Zionism or anything but Judaism.
* [13 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513221214/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1260694341024178181): I was in campus left circles and some Palestine activist groups in my youth, and I left that milieu due to the vitriolic anti-whiteness. Usually in the US Palestinian campus groups are literally lead by Jews. If not Jews, then Arab women that have nose rings and say they're LGBT.
* [13 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513221045/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1260693971183063045): ISIS is a Zionist proxy army, and unlike Palestinians, they enjoy medical care in Israeli hospitals. In any case, I've always associated Palestine with the left, not Islamism. But I can understand why whites would be averse to getting involved with Palestine activism in the west.
* [13 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513220858/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1260693520874160133): First of all, it's funny to see people associating support for Palestine with Islamism. Historically the Palestinian cause has been much more linked to secular leftist and some nationalist movements than to Islamism. Islamism is actually much closer to Zionism. See ISIS.
* [13 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513220714/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1260693085069197312): So, against my better judgment, I'm going to do a thread on Palestine. I'm not calling anyone a racist liberal. I'm not telling anyone to don a keffiyeh and pick up a bunch of rocks to throw at Israeli tanks. I'm telling you where I stand on the issue. Take it or leave it.
* [13 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513214904/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1260688514317987841): No, I think when it is two males the dynamic changes. He is cringing before him.

It's a defined group. And they control Zionist policy in Israel and banking and media in the west. And they are people that go into the column "jew" That's who is creating all these problems.
* [13 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513214324/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1260687085394178048): It's about Jews. It's not about abstractions. Jews are doing this. Not Europeans. Not whites. Not "settler colonialism." Jews. It's funny how you're willing to blame "white supremacy" but when I say, no, it's jews, suddenly it's not about race.
* [13 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513214057/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1260686471910043653): Whatever. They're Jews. They're not white. There are 700 million whites, American and European, that have no right to citizenship in Israel and are not welcome there. Anti-whiteness is a Jewish meme, getting Arabs to buy into it only strengthens Jews.
* [13 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513214018/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1260686307635929089): Whatever. They're Jews. They're not white.

He knows that Israel is extremely unpopular and is trying to blame whites while assuring people that he is a "good" jew. Yet he is not in Israel actually trying to stop Jewish supremacy. He is here telling people angry about it to blame whites.
* [13 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513211606/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1260680216390893569): This dude is a Jewish communist trying to blame white people for shit that Jews do. https://twitter.com/jewcommie/status/1260614758119735298

Tell them that the Jews are all dead, they were killed by Nazis in WWII. Then the Nazis pretended to be Jews in order to keep doing their Nazi shit like usury and multiculturalism. So all jews are secret Nazis

So they can easily claim that when they were corrected and they acted within 24 hours, which is the grace period you get. But of course i only takes a few minutes to slander people.

The book was the equivalent of a Dinesh D'Souza book from its time. And it receives now the amount of respect that D'Souza will get in 70 years.

IMO the book is obviously a fake and was meant to get US conservatives riled up for war with Germany. I also disagree about the Marxist nature of NS, but that's another discussion.

The guy was only in the Nazi party a short time before he quit and moved to the US. He gained citizenship here by 1941. "Hitler Speaks" which in the US was titled "Voice of Destruction" was war propaganda. I am skeptical that it would suddenly be rehabilitated.

* [11 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200511032438/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1259685795683803136): Well, look at it this way. If I see rich Jews saying White nationalists are terrorists while donating millions to Zionist groups, and I see rich Whites also saying that White nationalists are terrorists and donating millions to Zionist groups, what should I conclude from that?
* [11 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200511030427/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1259680707498172423): Depends on what you are blaming them for. For being rich? Or for exercising systematic control over US political and media institutions in order to promote their own ethnic agenda? At this point rich whites are just along for the ride, and they have no desire to be anything else.
* [11 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200511025351/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1259678051140546560): ZIons or scions? The trouble with Anglo Saxon inheritors of generational wealth is that they have no group loyalty, while Jews of wealth dump huge money into pro-Jewish causes and lobby groups. Rich Anglos also dump huge amounts of money into pro-jewish causes.
* [11 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200511025029/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1259677204629389312): However, anyone that has observed how Jews operate within systems has seen how they can leverage a cohesive minority into effective control. And in this sector they have  at least a plurality if not an absolute majority of the big players.

They are actually not all Jewish, though certainly more than half of them are. The rest of them are representatives of various international interest groups. A topic worthy of more research.

The mainstream right and left are not equipped to deal with this reality. The old world of talking about congress, courts, the executive branch is increasingly irrelevant. These are increasingly window dressing for a fed run country.

People already oppose H1Bs and immigration. These protests don't make any demands like that because they are GOP astroturf. They already have the backing of conservative inc. They are designed to go nowhere.

The question is, will this be headed off at the pass by reactionary politics, or will people be able to see through it and organize to make demands in their own interest.
* [10 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200510234331/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1259630152545435648): Another way they are going to try to squash an organized response once it ends it to set those that thought the virus was real against those that thought it was fake. Not just in the online right, but throughout the political spectrum.

This shit is a fait accompli. So now what do we do with it? Let's say I accept the entire thing was an op. Ok, the next political step ought to be the same anyway. They have to pay for it.

So they are responsible to those affected by it, and they should have to make people whole.
* [10 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200510231147/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1259622163314806790): I honestly don't get the logic of not making demands of the state on behalf of those rendered jobless due to lockdown. They shut it down and created this situation. Ok, is there some reason they should not have to make the people that they damaged by doing this whole?
* [10 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200510230213/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1259619757474623489): It is. But that doesn't mean that whites are somehow independent of systemic control structures. It just means that we are putting more in to the system than we get out.
* [10 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200510225737/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1259618599037173763): The demand to end immigration should be articulated. And the fact that Trump's executive order was completely fake needs to be exposed to people. I did not see anyone making any demands regarding immigration at any of the lockdown protests.
* [10 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200510225406/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1259617713875550209): The answer is an organized political response that makes concrete demands of the state on behalf of those that lost jobs and income during the lockdown. Reactionary politics serve the purpose of heading off and preventing exactly this sort of thing from developing.
* [10 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200510225234/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1259617330151206914): The hollow pretense that white people don't ask the government for help because they are independent or something will not feed anyone's kids. And the independence was obviously illusory, or else the lockdown wouldn't have had the effect it did.
* [10 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200510224907/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1259616461095604226): Once the lockdown ends, which it will, where will the political energy that was mustered behind this movement go? It will disappear, and we will have a new status quo, except millions of people will be out of work, and there will be no organized advocacy for them.
* [10 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200510224224/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1259614772548579334): The trouble is that the anti-lockdown protests carried with them an unspoken assumption that the status quo prior to lockdown, where people went to work and bought groceries when they chose, meant they were free of system control. The lockdown itself showed this wasn't the case.
* [10 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200510223958/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1259614154526281728): I have always said that the anti-lockdown protests should have been coupled with demands for mandatory rehires of those that were laid off or furloughed, and government checks for people until they return to their pre-lockdown income levels.
* [10 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200510223739/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1259613576383381506): The problem with anti-lockdown politics is that it offers nothing once the lockdown ends, which it will be over the next several weeks. What then will be said for the millions of people without jobs? What demands will be made then? None.
* [10 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200510223059/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1259611623892934660): Jerry Saltz is a New York City Jewish "art critic." He has done literally nothing of value in his entire life. https://twitter.com/golfrightCEO/status/1259587089110380544

If your protest actually opposes the power structure in any significant way it will be shut down with various violent tactics, including bringing in groups of thugs to attack it with impunity.
* [10 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200510211034/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1259591661006585856): Protesting against black on white violence is not an approved issue to say the least, neither is protesting against immigration or any other racial issue for whites. And backs are organized by groups with money and power to protest over racial bait issues all the time.
* [10 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200510210806/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1259591037598814210): "White" protests happen if they are for politically safe issues, and if they are organized by existing organizations. We've seen what happens when unapproved white protests happen, as they were all through 2016 and 2017 until they were shut down with extreme force.
* [10 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200510210406/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1259590032630910976): There is a tacit assumption that whites don't protest *as whites* ever, and that black protests happen in a coordinated fashion in response to various media created spectacles. All of this is true. Protests in America are almost always astroturfed.
* [10 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200510210155/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1259589482451517442): Where are the protests and marches? This stuff happens frequently enough, surely much more frequently than white on black violence. So where are they? The commenter seems to implicitly understand that protests are organized by the powerful.
* [10 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200510205906/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1259588775614742529): Whenever you look at comments on conservative sites when an incident like the Delaware cemetery murders of two whites by a black man makes it to the news, you see things like this. The assumptions behind that question are interesting to explore.   https://www.foxnews.com/us/gunman-dead-after-shooting-at-delaware-veterans-cemetery-leaves-elderly-couple-dead  pic.twitter.com/cpL1dEB0d8

Matt Walsh, Andrew Klaven, Dana Loesch, Kevin McCarthy and every fucking GOP shill is responsible for amplifying the "white supremacists hunt down innocent black jogger" line while ignoring this outrage.

It's not true, but here we have Sheldon Francis, dressed in black with a face mask and a scoped rifle, just shooting down an elderly white couple. He literally hunted them.

The genetic characteristics may be emergent, but the actual actions and plans are set out, and we can look at them.

The strategy exists and creates different agendas depending on circumstances. But Jews as a people have an agenda, and it is decided by a pyramid structure of Jewish organizations that quite literally set an agenda.

* [10 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200510190941/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1259561238868168706): All explanations for this that rely on some kind of psychological characterization of whites as fundamentally liberal or anti-racist are copes. It has not been like this historically. The only way it make sense is if people in power have an agenda against us.
* [10 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200510190652/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1259560530718720001): If you actually step back and think about it, the idea that in a democratic system where 65% are white you wouldn't get even a single opportunist that would go out and say "I'm going to do something for white people!" is insane.

The only way to explain this is that those in power hate whites
* [10 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200510113213/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1259446113716838401): No. But the court systems of many countries take it for granted that they were, so he could have been charged.

He fled with the Nazis rather than stay in Auschwitz and wait for the Soviets. So he says. Someone told me this part of the story was removed in a later edition but I've never checked.

What is interesting though is how guys like Gabbai are treated like heroes in the Jewish community. He was even in several Hollywood movies in the 50s.

The dirty work was done by him and some other jewish inmates, gassing thousands of their fellow jews, with only a couple of SS overseeing it. Surely they could have put up a fight.
* [10 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200510110219/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1259438588485402624): If Gabbai had resisted the SS, he would have been shot. If Demjanjuk deserted, he would have been shot. The punishment was the same. And Demjanjuk never admitted to personally taking part in the murder of thousands of people.
* [10 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200510110005/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1259438027367120899): John Demjanjuk was prosecuted in 2009 in Germany for assisting in the smooth operation of a death camp. The argument that he was just a guard was rejected because he could have deserted. If he deserted he would have been shot. He and Gabbai were under the same amount of coercion.

Why was he never prosecuted for this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgrJ0jvy_sA

But I would bet that there is some kind of therapy in a sane world that could help some of these people. But for some, if praying every day means they don't go cruising in assless chaps, then it is what it is.

If you oppose paying them to stay here, you are taking sides against Israel and involving yourself in the issue.

Not while Zionists control your government. They will forcefully prevent their return to Palestine. So as usual, the obstacle here is Jews and Zionism. This was always the case.

We subsidize it both with actual money and by taking on the people they don't want. I oppose this. Palestinians should return home and Jews need to learn to be decent neighbors.

This seems like a no brainer to me.

Their main political demand is the right to return to their homeland. Israel forcefully refuses them this right. I support them over Israel. Neutrality on the issue supports the status quo, which means they stay.

See the John Crawford shooting. Clearly unjustified shooting of a black guy by a cop. You probably never heard of it.

Open and shut cases of clear guilt, they actually don't care about. They do this to stoke hatred against whites.

Conservative think tanks right now are trying to cobble together a kosher "post liberal" or really "post conservative" platform to hoodwink whites with for the next few decades.

Benefits that younger generations of whites are unlikely to be able to take advantage of. They hate the Democratic party, even if unconsciously, for racial reasons.

Strip the rhetoric of anti-whiteness, tell whites what you will do for them, and they will love it.

It's bashing the people lying to them and distracting them. Don't gaslight yourself that GOP ideology is actually popular, or would be popular if alternatives were given a platform absent anti-whiteness.

Like claiming Hollywood is made up of secret Nazi Satanists.

My answer was, nothing, do what you want. You want something more than that?  "Why are you so sensitive?" strikes me as a concern troll, and I just don't have time for it.

You think I am trying to force you to do something? This debate is a waste of time. Politically I oppose Israel and support Palestine, and this coincides with pro-white views. You do as you wish.

This does not mean this is the only source for migration to Europe, but it is a major source. The point is that Israel is the enemy of Europe in this respect.

What is your strategy for getting rid of them? Zionist wars create refugees and Jewish lawyers and NGOs work to resettle them in Europe.

Strengthening Israel further will not make them want to go there. The data is in on the idea of giving Jews a state to make them go away. It failed.

This is the reality. Should that ever occur, we can dictate to them anyway, so even then why give them Israel? They can have an Israel sized slice of Siberia.

There is literally no reason for them to do that when they hold all the cards, even less so when whites cast their support behind Israel.

The only way they go there is if we have the power to tell them they must. At that point all of this is academic, and it's not he Zionist project anymore, it's our project, and we can put them in Siberia for all I care.

I reject this idea that I need to support the Zionist entity because in some future world I would like to ship all Jews there. The problem is power. If we have the power to ship Jews somewhere in the first place, then none of this matters.

You could replace Jews with Palestinians here and it's the same. It's not like we don't already see Jews shipping their Arab enemies to Europe.

And they have never tried to undermine my country. If people care so much for this kind of consistency, then why do Jews get away with their total inconsistency?

This is light switch brain thinking. If you're racist against Arabs you should support them having independent states free from Zionism. Israel starts the wars and Jewish NGOs bring in the refugees. The Kosher 1,2 punch.

Jews have already shown that giving them their own state did not lead to them leaving or forfeiting power in the west. Just the opposite.

What do you think happens if Israel wins that conflict? Where do hey go? They get dumped on the West, just like the Syrians.

We oppose Zionist policy in all else, why grant it to them in this one area? What do we gain from giving something to the Jews for free? I supported Assad and Qadaffi, and that dovetailed with white interests. Who cares if conservatives get mad?

Nothing drives people away more than endless public discussions of what is or is not productive. No one has any data about what is productive, they work from their own biases.

* [ 2 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502055114/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1256461196863123456): They don't defer to them. They control them and create outcomes. But their religion itself is legalistic. Pilpul is court disputation, which is where they practice this stuff. The ideology they imposed on our courts come from their idea that procedure and cleverness trump truth.

It's powerful. I've seen it happen to people.
* [ 2 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502050743/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1256450249335472128): For Jews, these people are saints and martyrs, they are not fallible, which is why so many stupid fucking stories make it through. Goys see this stuff and they fill in the evidential void in their mind. They assume it has to be there. But it's not, which gives us an advantage.
* [ 2 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502050502/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1256449572437659649): The other proof is endless tearful testimonies from Jews, 99.9% of which say nothing about gas chambers or even any killings. They just lived through Nazis being in power. This has an impact when you're a kid, along with atrocity porn of piles of dead bodies.
* [ 2 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502050255/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1256449038444048384): Goys don't view court or religion that way. We put truth above cleverness and don't see the court as infallible. It could be wrong, particularly if there is evidence. Jews don't care about evidence, they won through procedure, so they won. That is how they see it.
* [ 2 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502050023/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1256448403317325824): Think of the proofs Jews use for the holocaust. "It was proven in court! They  confessed!" Court is a religious thing for Jews. Pilpul is done in the temple. The Talmud is  legalistic. It's not about truth, but winning by being clever. Just getting the confession makes it "true."
* [ 2 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502045056/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1256446024509423617): The idea of having to prove it scientifically is actually offensive to Jews. But to goys, it just makes sense. The brainwashing doesn't tell you anything scientific. You fill in that part yourself, you assume it's there. Finding out it's not is a jarring experience for people.
* [ 2 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502044500/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1256444529462435840): Christianity for sure.

It's just persecuting heretics. But no matter what, they were too late in trying to prove it scientifically, and now they never can. So it will eventually crumble.
* [ 2 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502044135/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1256443670489948160): The Jews never developed a rigorous technical or archeological record. They didn't even really think of it until too late. Under the revisionist assault they cobbled together a literal Rube Goldberg holocaust machine, but it falls apart immediately.
* [ 2 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502043828/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1256442887103041536): Goys assume there is a ton of evidence for it. Why else all the TV shows and movies and school assemblies? But all you are really shown is some old jew talking about Nazis being mean to them. This is a religious rite for Jews, but not us, for us it's still a historical event.
* [ 2 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502043559/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1256442260381732864): For us, it lacks that emotional resonance, even with all the brainwashing. Even liberal goys secretly make Anne Frank in the ashtray jokes at parties. The brainwashing tells us it's a tripwire, not that it's morally wrong to make fun of it or question it, but that it's dangerous.
* [ 2 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502043359/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1256441759263047685): I think ultimately the holocaust becoming a religious narrative for Jews will be its undoing. The idea of "proving" religion is weird. No one ever asks you to do that. It misses the point. Raul Hillberg at the Zundel trial was thunderstruck when asked for scientific evidence.
* [ 2 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502042334/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1256439135830716417): The lack of human remains and the claim that this is because the Nazis dug them all up and burned them without a trace combined with the lack of documentary evidence and the claim the nazis used a secret code to discuss gassings usually does it. After that it's just padding.
* [ 2 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502041709/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1256437521829048320): Even when I see /ourguys wanting to step around it or avoid it, or assert that there is overwhelming proof, it's not worth it, I know they have no idea what the allegations are and what the evidence is. Sit that guy down and tell him, and he'll be thunderstruck at the absurdity.
* [ 2 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502041407/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1256436758457339905): There's a reason Jews target children with emotional and psychological manipulation rather than facts. The "facts" they are peddling are stupid and insane. Just telling the layman the official allegations is half the work oof revisionism.
* [ 2 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502041155/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1256436206449164288): Best way to start any conversation on this with a normie is to ask them what they actually know. They don't know anything. So then you tell them the official story. At first they won't believe you that that's the official story because it's so absurd.
* [ 2 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502040853/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1256435439281545218): It's fun to sperg out on the details of Auschwitz and the other camps, and it's necessary. But the best arguments for laymen are intuitive rather than technical. Most people don't even know what the allegations are, and when they hear them, they raise a skeptical eyebrow.
* [ 2 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502040141/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1256433631150706689): I am arguing for her, not argying. Spelling errors are a tell for emotional stress.

That's not an option for the holocaust because the Nazis managed to retrace their steps in 1944 and 1945 and burn up, grind the bones and disperse the ashes of the dead and make the ground appear undisturbed.

I have more than 400. I have more than the Nazis could gas at Treblinka on a Tuesday after burning the cripples. And you have zero, and you have to live with that, buddy. https://twitter.com/darwin_thames/status/1255909957389688837

It's so absurd the people that want to defend it will debunk it themselves when confronted with it. Most of them have no idea what the story is, they are just tools that watch Netflix and furry porn so they feel like they need to stop Nazis.

If you want to make it sound more reasonable so people will believe it, then congrats, you're a holocaust denier. But remember, the story is the Jews waved gold coins at the Ukrainians, who dropped their guns and were killed.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430181406/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255923370853642245): This is the dumb shit you say when you don't know what the shot is. The alleged number wasn't 400. It was 2000, sometimes up to 9000 a day at Treblinka. And the automatic weapons don't matter, because the Jews waved gold coins at the Ukrainians and they dropped their weapons. https://twitter.com/darwin_thames/status/1255909957389688837

So is it wrong to want to do violence to enemies or not? https://twitter.com/darwin_thames/status/1255918458174410759

You don't know the shot, in fact you are just making it up in your own mind what you think happened.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430175955/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255919804562710532): And now we see the result. A politician tells the Jews they need to stay the fuck inside because they are spreading a disease TO EACH OTHER and the entire butt goy conservative media complex that won't pluck a hair to defend white people goes full fucking spazz mode.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430175615/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255918879634849795): If in 1945 the Jews had claimed, but hey, the nazis shot some of us on the Eastern front, the world would have died laughing. The United states had just finished incinerating 500,000 innocent people in Tokyo, Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430175429/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255918430810714114): Jews have gotten the world to think that rivers of tears must flow if one of them gets a hangnail. They did this by selling you the lie that women and children were gassed and thrown into furnaces alive or electrocuted with a cattle prod in their ass or whatever the fuck.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430175226/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255917917683810306): They even executed some if they were soviet commissars that abused the gentile peasants, or if they were terrorists launching attacks and sabotage. Every army does this in a war. So I cry no tears for dead jews.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430175006/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255917332737732615): The systematic lie is gas chambers and industrialized executions of millions. The truth is it was a fucking war, and the Jews were on one side, as commissars, partisans, saboteurs, propagandists and in rare cases actual soldiers. So yes, the Nazis killed some of their enemies.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430174817/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255916873780248579): Something that happens when I talk about the holocaust is some guys come in, in good faith, warning me too be careful because he Nazis actually did kill some Jews. I take this as self evident. The issue is that a systematic lie has been told and people need to be told the truth.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430173734/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255914177828392960): People have been cooped up too long. No one cares about your personal grievances or buzzword accusations. Every time you do it, a Jew rubs his hands. Just go after the Js. This shit is not hard.

Completely. They simply do not fucking care. It's a minstrel show for the goyim. They care about strongly worded letters from the Jewish community.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430171035/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255907389167087618): If you're a politician and you get a letter like this from "The Jewish Community" you know you have to do what they want or else money gets pulled and the media goes into full attack mode and you're done.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430170605/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255906253060149250): This is the optics Jew approach to Diblasio. Dumbass goy conservatives just scream Nazi because they are just cooning for their Jew massa. Liberal Jews take this sort of reasonable yet vaguely threatening tone because this actually will get DiBlasio to fall in line. https://twitter.com/jdforward/status/1255905254715129857

And I wouldn't   say that there are some that are not OK with white genocide. You're looking at it wrong. There are some that see the US right wing as useful to their ends. That is all.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430163250/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255897889001410563): It fits in to the jignat/optics k!ke paradigm. Netanyahu and his jignats wanted Trump badly because of what he would do for Israel, while the majority of American Jews wanted Hillary because they are more alarmed about white nationalism developing in America.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430163012/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255897222744543237): This doesn't necessarily mean it was true, because the Jewish community in the US was very much against Trump, and Netanyahu is known for making statements that he personally can control America, but it sows that basically the whole thing is an argument between Jews.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430162717/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255896490712727553): It's obvious from reading these documents, even redacted, that Israel's representatives were totally confident they had the power to control the outcome of the election.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430162524/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255896015988838407): Roger Stone colluded with Israel to get Trump elected, not Russia. https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/israel-mentioned-in-newly-released-roger-stone-fbi-documents-1.8809884

The story is that there were 120 Nazis and several hundred Jewish workers and they would gas 2000 Jews at once. Not plausible.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430154448/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255885799134048258): Yankel Wiernik is not some marginal figure either. He is the main source for the Treblinka death camp story. https://twitter.com/mec_en_acier/status/1255789771970002945
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430060058/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255738871792447490): I disagree. The best story is the truth. If you say they deserved it, they can paint you as severely immoral even if Jews did start communism. You have to just tell people what really happened.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430055508/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255737406373986305): And if boomer retards are your target audience, you'll probably be frustrated. These people's brains are fried from lead paint and statins. I try to talk to Xers and younger.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430055243/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255736798308896769): But keep in mind, I did some 550 episodes of my show before ever doing in depth revisionism. So we told people about Jews and communism and Jews and banks and Jews and immigrations and anti-whiteness for years.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430055133/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255736503600373761): Yes, and those people have no idea about Jews and communism and they also know Nazis bad because they gassed Jews, and they also don't actually really give much of a fuck about Jews getting gassed all at the same time. You have to understand who you're talking to.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430054836/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255735761279881226): I never disputed this. I still wouldn't put it like that though. Why did Nazis see Jews as an adversary is a better way to phrase it. But keep in mind, most people see Nazis as bad because of the killings and don't know about anything else, so you still have to disprove it.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430054533/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255734991344078850): That's interesting, because I never wondered about that. Not because I knew why, but because I didn't care. I think this is how most people react. It's beaten into their head, so they endure it and don't ask questions.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430053955/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255733577163182087): Well, if I were asked that question I would have answered that question, not talked about gas chambers.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430053847/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255733290801258496): However, I don't think people are actually morally outraged about the holocaust. I think they understand it's a taboo, and they are expected to say x or y about it, but I don't really think anyone really gives a fuck. People invoke it in moral terms, but as a power play.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430053412/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255732138923696131): Yes, I just take it for granted that this is part of the story when you go into details about what happened. When you say to concede "nazis wanted to kill Jews" it sounded like you were suggesting admitting they wanted to kill them for no reason. I agree with what you are saying.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430052557/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255730061413679104): Yes, you're right.

* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430052059/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255728812983271424): Often times the locals would start pogromming the Jews as soon as the Nazis moved into an area after the Soviets pulled out, and they would have to stop them and restore order.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430051913/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255728365354565634): When discussing this stuff with normies I find that asking them to explain what they know to me, and how, is more effective than an information dump. The key is to get them to realize they have been propagandized and to get them mad about that, not to dump loads of info on them.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430051548/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255727506692415489): Ok, so you're saying tell people that Jews were behind Bolshevism and were carrying out partisan attacks on the German troops, thus justifying actions against them? Obviously that is part of the story. I will also challenge people to tell me why they think Jews are so innocent.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430051207/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255726579486949376): And look at your own behavior. You went right to Babi Yar. You didn't say anything about gas chambers. Why not? Because you know that shit is indefensible. Holocaust scholars know it too. Their narrative is on the defensive.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430050940/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255725961737363459): Of course most people don't know the details. That's why they believe it. That's why you tell them this shit. For normies, I challenge them to tell me what happened. When they can't, that makes them think twice.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430050311/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255724330652229632): The major works on the holocaust cite these type of stories though, they just cherry pick and sanitize them so they don't sound so absurd. The above story doesn't have much that can be saved though, so they probably tossed it.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430045948/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255723481234378752): I'm sure it was real in someone's mind.

I see no reason to do that. This is a factual, historical investigation. What actually happened is the only question that matters.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430045339/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255721932927926273): Saying that the "Nazis wanted to kill Jews" doesn't mean anything. The question is one of fact. What is alleged? What of those things that are alleged can be proven? What of those things that are alleged cannot be proven, but are credible? What is obviously fake?
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430044401/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255719507919867906): And of course I believe that Ukranians pogrommed some Jews after Jewish crimes were discovered. I dunno about death counts or any other outlandish tales told about that though. The Nazis had to actually restrain the local populace from slaughtering Jews in the East.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430044027/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255718610934341632): I believe the SS probably shot some Jews in Kyiv. The Story that they shot 33,000, buried them in a ravine, hid the bodies by blasting boulders to cover them over and then came back and excavated them and burned them without a trace I do not believe.
* [30 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430043634/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1255717635263782914): A lot of these stories were made up by stupid and provincial Polish ghetto Jews that just didn't know how things work, so they made stuff up for dramatic effect, like the soldiers picking off hands and legs at the fence, but never considered how absurd they sounded to others. lol

Fine. You're still naive. Jews are not fighting for your freedom or anyone's freedom. They are fighting only for their own special treatment. Side with them and you accept permanent shabbos goy status.

The suffering of Jews, the holocaust, was simply Jews having to obey rules set by gentiles. It was Jews losing power. This was the emergency for them.

It has to stop. The holocaust has to be discredited. Jewish power is intolerable, and it's an emergency. It has to end.

I want to attack the power system at its source, not beg it for scraps around the edges. Jews must be *normalized*. That is, they need to become normal people, not special people. We have to be able to police them, to set rules that they must follow.

You don't because you know what I know. People aren't actually morally outraged by the holocaust. They just know it's the highest law of the land. It's the source of power for the elite.

They are above the law. Any attempt to make them adhere to normal rules will invoke the holocaust, paralyzing any action that needs to be taken. The holocaust is the source of their power.

And how do you know this was in Ukraine? Other times it has been claimed it was in Poland. And how does it prove systematic killing of Jews? Because a guy was shot? Maybe he deserved it.

This photo is a famous forgery. There are at least three versions of it, as you can see here. Often times it is claimed this scene is taking place in Poland, not Ukraine. But even if genuine, how does this prove millions?  https://twitter.com/Miha9C2/status/1255296614907904006  pic.twitter.com/W0Z37h5gdH

I think some get a feeling of moral superiority out of it, and some just hold tolerance and "free debate" as an ideal. But they take these positions because they are underdogs.

They don't think so. Assume they're lying to you until proven otherwise. Even then be skeptical.

That's an intolerable situation. Allowing a Jew to shit on your race out of some hope he'll grant you scraps from his table is not 4d chess. It's just cucking.

Prager says he is against immigration to attract viewers so he can turn around and say this shit. He is just a liar. You will never get any immigration policy out of Prager or his tribe.

Then it turns out not to be, and they seek upcummies elsewhere. Very sad really.

Women feel like they need some kind of "appreciation" for it above and beyond getting it done and getting paid. What they really want is a husband and children to give them love and comfort.

It's why working women go on and on about being "appreciated" for their dumb job, when men just do it.

As of today, people accusing people of being secret Duginists feels like a gayop to derail. I'm not a secret anything. I tell people what I think.

But then you are only bolstering their agenda, not pushing your own.

Either attack someone's actual positions or don't. I don't know Dugin well, but if I happen upon a point of agreement with him, I'm not gonna shy away from it because of deep concerns.

Yielding to the idea that I should do this grants another opening for attack. I tell people what I think, if I had to account for every single tripwire or every tendency beforehand there would be no end to it.

Well, please preface that with 20 minutes of how you disagree with China or else you're a Duginist.

I hadn't heard that word since years ago Glenn Beck put it on his chalkboard. Seems like it gets leveled at those that are harshly critical of liberal capitalism. Why not refute the ideas rather than do guilt by association?

I see no reason to make it easy for them.

The fact that the party is so obviously trying to transition to a multiracial party and has no intention of ever representing its voters is why.

The point is that he never seems to get why it is so easy for him to get white people banned, but he can never seem to manage it for Jews.

They obviously want it to stop being of white people as well, and have two multiracial parties. I obviously think whites need to get away from the GOP.

They do not want whites to think that there is any institution that belongs to them.

The first two years of Trump the media complained that they couldn't break his wall of support with whites with their smear campaigns. What broke white support was Trump's total abandonment of all of his promised policies. https://twitter.com/RyanGirdusky/status/1253913353115906048

Not because they hate unions as such, but because their union does a lot of bullshit promotion of multiculturalism, feminism and homosexuality and not so much advocating for their rights.

But I'm just like "Yeah, that's dumb."

In 1989, he tried to prove the gas chamber myth real with nothing other documents and without relying on eyewitness testimony. The result is hilarious.

It has been acceptable to call for a complete immigration moratorium since then. Trump hasn't talked about immigration in 2 years. He's doing this because he can't lean on muh great economy anymore.

It's just a question of whether the rug gets pulled out in a way that benefits Trump politically or not. I kind of hope for option one, because I want people to want to cancel the federal courts.

Worst for him: He just has to walk it back and sign some weak shit.

But plenty of people with plausible deniability have been destroyed too. Just don't overthink it. If you are constantly wringing your hands, you're not being pragmatic.

But that same person will disavow anyone they have ever been anywhere near that has been called Nazi, or that has perhaps sported a swastika in the past. That's weak

It has to be rehabilitated in the sense that the accusation and association can't send people rushing to disavow. As long as that weapon still works, Jews will keep firing it.

Markets operated in the Third Reich, as did private ownership of capital. But capital was beneath the state in power. There was no globalism, no outsourcing, no capital flight.

I know you are probably a megalomaniacal javascript programmer that hopes to convince a tech CEO of your worldview, but trust me, it will change nothing. https://twitter.com/JimSellers2020/status/1252060790158483463

What about just a Protestant White? They get nothing.

Go up against Jews in court and watch the Judge throw every single Enlightenment principle directly out the window. GTFO. https://twitter.com/JimSellers2020/status/1252057696276230150

Because she is a Jew. No white person coming out of the milieu that she was part of would ever get that.

And she never apologized because Jews don't have to. Imagine a white person that did that, or even that disavowed under pressure, getting this kind of media and financial support.

And I got on a Warski stream to confront her about it as well a couple years ago. She apologized to me and then later tried to get me to muster the alt-right to go after one of her enemies for something. I can't recall all the details.

The nose job pics, the spare tire pics, the nasal voice, chaining herself to twitter's door. People were absolutely brutal. Sometimes to the point where even I was like, ok, that's a bit much. But she's Jewish. Terrible optics meant nothing to her.

She was a laughingstock for years. People made fun of her looks, her voice and the dumb things she would say. Yet now she has raised 600k and is a contender in a congressional race.

But if a Jewish racist can run and get media and financial support, then why can't a white one?

It's against a Jew that is knowledgeable on the topic and a tbd partner for him. He comes out of the "less wrong" milieu where they sperg out on formal logic and such.

And yes, they do claim that lampshades are "likely though not proven" and they take all Jewish testimony as gold standard. They want to set the argument back 40 yrs.

But this takes time and effort and will never get comparable search engine exposure. The official historians of course never publicly back them, but they are probably silently glad they are out there.

This is one of the main vectors that gets people interested in revisionism, so if they can make you back off or second guess at that stage, they win.

They know they're lying, but to the noob, even a skeptic, their shit can seem plausible, and then they show you an old piece of paper with German writing. So why do they do this, when they know all their shit can be debunked?

* [19 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200503022743/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1251921574908878848): The document in question is from 1942. So if they were ordered to cease "production" of heads in 1942, and if Morgen found no such items in 1943, why did they suddenly appear in 1945, produced by the US military alongside other items confirmed to be fake? It doesn't add up.

There were even flattering portrayals of him in the press calling him the Nazi with a conscience and such things.

He was never charged at Nuremberg and was treated leniently after the war because he had prosecuted Nazi officers while in the SS. He died in 1982.
* [19 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200503022743/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1251921574908878848): Konrad Morgen, the SS judge that investigated the Kochs in 1943, said nothing about any heads in his report. He interviewed camp staff and inmates. He testified at Nuremberg that he had searched the camp and the Koch residence up and down and found no such items.

There were no heads of Europeans or Jews ever found. This seems designed to rehabilitate a thoroughly debunked holohoax story, which is what that blog does.

Making a shrunken head involves stripping the skin off the skull and wrapping it around something else, not just messing around with material. Just a reprimand for this sort of thing? Really?

* [19 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200503022743/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1251921574908878848): Yes, I know. They are made by various savage tribes, but people in Europe in America did collect such things at one point. The US military displayed two shrunken heads at Buchenwald in 1945, saying they were made from prisoners there. Both heads were from South America.

This document was published by "Holocaust Controversies" an extremist blog that seeks to vindicate every possible holocaust story.

But the SS execution of Koch is incontrovertible, so they have to work with it. What this does is rescue the allegations of macabre experiments going on at Buchenwald, when there is no evidence of them. The shrunken heads shown by the US military were from South America.

Karl Koch was charged and convicted by an SS military court for ordering the execution of prisoners to cover up theft, embezzlement, and sexual misconduct.

Why not simply look at material conditions?

It was about class collaboration rather than class war. Sure, it wasn't a marxist revolution, but people obviously didn't want that, and they never have.

Have marxists ever compared their theory to actual events in Italy and Germany? No. It's merely a story they came up with to explain their failed revolution in Germany.

They simply came up with a cope and called it "scientific."

On the very same table where the heads are displayed, conveniently cut off in your image, is a lampshade that was claimed to be made of human skin.

Why can't your race be a thing to be proud of? If there is a guy that literally has nothing else, why do they desire to take even that from him?

I have always opposed outsourcing to China. Movies only need approval from China to be shown in China.

The period of deepest Soviet penetration of the US, mainly by Jewish agents, was the 40s and 50s. The Jews now run every institution in the US and the USSR is no more.

But the history of KGB subversion of the West is so intertwined with Jewry, and the subversion not only didn't stop, it accelerated after the cold war, so I conclude that Jews were the driving force.

If the KGB was doing gayops and demoralizing the West with Jewish agents, these were just Jew ops and the KGB was a vehicle.

Bezmenov primarily lectured to very conservative and Christian groups, IMO planting red herrings.

In reality he was talking about Jewish infiltration and demoralization. Yet he placed the blame on the KGB.

IMO he was simply a cold war US propaganda operative. As such, while he may have had some accurate critiques of the USSR, he also was promoting race mixing and going on and on about muh poor Jews.
* [ 9 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200409185543/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1248323325237043202): I see no reason to doubt it.

As such, he also promoted race mixing and talked about the plight of Jews all the time.

One of the things he would go on and on about was the plight of Jews in the USSR. This was a big issue in the 1980s for Jewish lobby groups, so he was obviously playing to that agenda.

Alex did a video explaining this. He put ketchup on his gloves and then touched things to make the point. Gloves would unnecessarily complicate this task.

To make the point put on gloves, cover them with ketchup and then do a task. See how much shit has ketchup on it afterwards.

Opening the box, getting the pizza out, putting it on something else etc. This is the fastest and easiest way.

This way, all foreign substances introduced into your home are cooked at 200 for 5 minutes. This will not hurt a pizza box, but will kill any virus on it. Then you can just put it on the kitchen table and eat it normally.

So they know whose butt to kiss to prevent that from happening. Zionist power is not always so obvious, but it's clear that foreign nations act as if it were real.

When Trump was threatening a tariff on Japanese autos in 2018, Shinzo Abe had a meeting with Netanyahu where he ate out of a shoe. The AJC gave Abe a medal in June 2019. Trump's Sept 2019 deal with Japan had no tariff. Japan knows who pulls the strings https://twitter.com/JackBNi65287245/status/1246556825144766464

Because there can be no non-judgmental assessment of Nazi policy, successful policy is bad because it helped Nazis. Imagine an entire society crippled by this kind of thinking.

You have to read between the lines.

After all it was the US that incinerated hundreds of thousands of Japanese with napalm and nuclear weapons, not Hitler. Just goes to show that this sort of thing is dictated by power.

My basic understanding is that Hitler did what was essentially MMT, and pulled out of speculation markets and increased production through direct fiscal policy.

Add that to the already falling mark.

Germany had to pay the reparations in gold and foreign currency, and they were pegged to the value of German exports. The need for Germany to buy foreign currency to pay the debt drove its price up relative to marks.

But that's not the whole story. The terms of the London payment plan made the Mark basically a toxic asset. It wasn't simply that there were a lot of them.

Communist terrorism inside Germany, the Soviet threat another, the humiliation of Germany in WWI, the French occupation of the Ruhr, the desire to reunite German speaking peoples, cultural subversion of the Jews etc. Many such reasons.

They are a result of constant reaction, people sure that elites are lying, but unable to discern how or why. When you develop a worldview, you understand elite motives and their actions make more sense to you.

The average white or blue collar guy that lives fairly modestly is in the best spot.

I challenge any White person to look me in the eye and tell me that a fucking African beheading a 7 year old White girl doesn't set off a visceral, primal instinct. If you say no, you're either lying or you are so enervated by soy that you're not human. https://twitter.com/RowdyRamzan/status/1246162397187977216

Yes, I am more outraged when an outgroup member kills one of my own race. Ingroup murders are a matter of law, outgroup murders are a matter of war.

No one has to justify themselves to this asshole. If a white adult victimizes a white child and I express outrage, would he be in my mentions asking if I would care if it was refugee that did it? No. https://twitter.com/LachezarRoev/status/1246157662389231617

Obviously there is an official narrative. But the "suggestion" as this guy says, is far more important. What's important is the impression people take away from the holocaust indoctrination. And that is that Jews were gassed.

Obviously it's a way to distract from a real conversation about *our* system. I want to bring manufacturing back. I want to shut down foreign lobbies. No one in DC wants to talk about that.

What is the upshot of that? It's not like Americans need to be persuaded to bring manufacturing back either. Put that on a ballot and it passes with 90% of the vote.

It's not about how to stop sending manufacturing overseas, it's not about foreign lobbying. It's about Chinese eating dogs and how they treat the Uighers.

The Jew who owned it sold it to an art dealer in 1934. Now his family is claiming he supposedly sold it at a loss because he was afraid of the Nazis.

Heimbach isn't doing that, but he won't be deradicalizing anyone either, so unlikely he will get any ZOGbux.

I don't want to be the global scumbag that the Jews are. When Jews do something that offends against normal morality, it's a bad look and bad strategy to say "I wish I could too."

If they don't want to help Italians, get the fuck out of Italy. Jews come in to our societies and then reserve special privileges for themselves.

The Evolutionary strategy argument is laid out in his first book, CoC is an addition to of it. There are also very specific conditions, like you must document that a Jew is operating on the basis of Jewish identity, not just assert.

They presented as objective to the public but were motivated by Judaism.

The first patients in America were Jews that attended AIPAC and then CPAC, infecting other elites.

An honest scholar would make note of the document, its uncertain origin, all the glaring errors and file it away as an intriguing yet unproven document and hope more information may come to light later.

Rather than dismissing a document with such shady origins that contains so many errors, he acts as if it is real and sets about to explain away all the errors by attributing totally unproven actions to people.

Haha funny stuff. This is all very clever and totally fine."

And the issue is not what is physically possible. It's what is claimed, and what is the evidence.

I'm skeptical to say the least. From when it was first mentioned in 1977 until 2019 they relied on Lipman's excerpt.

Did Immanuel Kant invent "White Privilege" theory? No. That was invented by Noel Ignatiev, a Jew. "Oh God, you're making lists of Jews!" Ok, well then why are you making lists of Germans by naming Kant? What a shitty and obvious distraction.

He takes the same position as Sammuel, that if you take a king he will take your sons, daughters, land, grain etc. So Paine was invoking the authority of the Bible, not really being antisemitic.

A "Bank of the US" can issue mortgages, car loans, consumer credit etc. The US government makes loans all the time. Private banks literally only exist to skim interest.

The Fed creates liquidity, and it sets interest rates through various monetary operations. Private banks borrow at the fed rate and issue various types of loans at an increased rate to make a profit.

But a poll stating that some 60% of Americans "support" Israel just means they are taking their view from the news media.

How are opinions on Israel even formed? The average person does not have an informed view on this just by nature. So who is informing them?

So the only people that debate Destiny should do it because they are confident they can roundly defeat his tactical style. Which is admittedly difficult, but not because anyone agrees with anything he says.

I agree the point is to effectively counter Destiny and if you don't, then it looks bad, but this is different than saying he was proven wrong. You fell for Destiny's act that the 27% poll was wrong, when it wasn't. "Undecided" does not mean "supports Israel."

That's just some feel good bullshit. The only issue is how he handled Destiny's tactical debate style, which as I have said is not actually easy to deal with.

So I say again, the real issue here, as it always is with Destiny, is did the guy handle the high speed torrent of verbal diarrhea effectively or not. Not who was right.

They know he is going to lie, they know he is going to gish gallop. They just like it. So at no point is it a battle of ideas. It's simply how high do you rate the other guy on how he handled his dishonest tactics. Did he get tripped up or not?

So the issue is more, how is his opponent going to handle him than what his positions and arguments are, which are absurd and no one actually agrees with them.

Not only is there a growing intellectual class of philosemites in China, which is being cultivated by wealthy Jewish donors, but Jews often sell US tech and intelligence secrets to China, since it's a way in to gaining influence there.

So that is worth listening to in between the shitposting. We made him use normal English and not medical jargon.

Now let's make it the only option for social interaction for 2 months. Everyone is gonna be a flaming asshole by the end of this.

* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316023134/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239378181284597761): Yes. He literally did the "it's ephebophilia not pedophilia" take and with far more detail and passion than people were comfortable with.
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316022618/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239376853770657792): It's more than sugar daddy. Sugar daddy's are just Johns, and often the woman controls them. In this case, Weinstein was clearly the more powerful figure and he used his power status and money to coerce women. Legally it's what he was found guilty of.
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316021639/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239374967084666880): He was found guilty in order to put the MeToo movement to bed. He had been made into the poster boy for it, while many other Jews involved like Matt Lauer and Les Moonves have been forgotten. He was the body in the wreckage.
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316021807/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239372493204439042): This is actually true.
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316020908/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239372259376214016): No, that's what you're saying Greg. He is saying Weinstein literally did nothing wrong. You said you believed Weinstein is a predator and rapist. I addressed this in the thread where I explained what 3rd degree rape is. Based on what you have said you believe, he is guilty of it.
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316020407/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239371272464760832): That's a cope. Leo Frank was lynched. But that was before our country was completely conquered by Jews. You are asking me to say that Jews using their status as conquerors and their money, power and privilege to rape white women is acceptable in some way. I don't buy it.
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316020024/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239370332982706181): The personal characteristics of the woman really don't matter.
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316015935/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239370128560660480): Yes, I do think so. And even if it is prostitution, do you like rich jews prostituting white girls? You want to defend that? Jews making white girls into whores is a form of racial domination, which is why Weinstein would make them say they loved his big Jewish dick.
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316015508/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239369479781523457): Basically, we have to defend jews engaging in racial domination, rape, humiliation and debasement of white women or else we could all be caught up in false rape charges. And make no mistake, it is racial domination. The Jews at Tablet know this.
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316015300/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239368474872479745): Andrew Anglin is asking you to not only believe in, but to celebrate and defend a world in which the only way white men will be safe from false rape accusations is one in which wealthy, perverted Hollywood jews are allowed to systematically groom and rape white women.
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316014643/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239366889064841218): And no, I don't think they will only go after jews, but no new legal tools were given to them with which to go after white men.
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316014549/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239366508578582530): Yes, activists say that. There is no legal precedent.
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316014204/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239365712239624194): I actually prefer such cases going to criminal court rather than some pervert Jew simply being able to wave his money in the air and get away with it. Send Matt Lauer to criminal court too. If feminists want to go scorched earth on Hollywood Jews, why the fuck should I care?
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316014204/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239365712239624194): Everyone remember the Jew Matt Lauer and the button under his desk he used to lock the door once he got a woman in his office? And it's not as if cases like that are not adjudicated anyway, they are just handled in civil court and often times the women are just paid off.
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316013838/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239365339626029057): The final cope argument is that even if no legal precedent was set in the Weinstein case, a social precedent was set in which prosecutors would be willing to go after more cases like Weinstein. But such cases always involve perverted Jews, so I don't really care.
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316013821/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239364764893052931): It feels like a feminist slogan.
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316013409/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239364265586425860): No one takes this seriously. This is cope posting for feminists.
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316012313/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239361546901499905): @BooksPajamas "Rape is rape" is a really dumb slogan, and this kind of annoying shit is why you have dudes that are antisemites and are even thinking twice about this case. The law doesn't agree either since it recognizes different degrees of rape. Stop using dumb feminist slogans.
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316011110/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239357015383834624): Jessica Mann's personal characteristics don't really matter very much, yes she was a woman of low moral character. But the question is, did she think that if she refused sex with Weinstein her career would be over? If so, that's how the charge actually works.
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316011110/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239357015383834624): Third degree rape means having sex with a person unable to give consent. Threat of job loss or blackballing is considered a situation in which a person cannot give consent. This agrees with common sense too. "Sick my dick or you're fired." everyone decent agrees this is a crime.
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316010808/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239356658167488517): Jessica Mann also accused Weinstein of one count of forcibly raping her, which is first degree rape, and he was acquitted of the charge. So if the courts must believe women, why was he not found guilty?
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316010356/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239355624837840907): So, if you think that there was some "deal" whereby it was understood that without the sex she wasn't getting a role or whatever, then sorry, you believe that Weinstein committed the crime of which he was found guilty.
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316010356/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239355624837840907): So, the only thing you could complain about is that it was he said, she said, and the jury believed her. But even Weinstein defenders have acknowledged there was a sex for favors "agreement" which means, no sex, no job, therefore third degree rape. So they believe women too.
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316010356/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239355624837840907): Muh precedent always felt like a cope, but I did some legal research and it's not true. No new precedent was set. Threat of loss of job or career to elicit sex has always been considered rape in the third degree, which is what Weinstein was found guilty of.
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316004947/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239352239879266304): Video of the Bernie/Biden debate. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rXZs9FviFQ

You can bet an email or a memo went out to network heads telling them to remove the word AIPAC, even in a neutral way. And I think it is just longstanding practice to never identify someone as Jewish in the media unless in certain contexts.
* [15 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200315113056/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239152064393068547): I just watched it. Tbh it looks to me like he is cursing the virus.

* [15 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200315080059/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239099108708749312): Power dynamics and racial dynamics make it go beyond a dry transaction. This is a Jew engaged in the deliberate humiliation and debasement of white women as a form of racial domination. That they were complicit because they wanted roles or money doesn't erase that.
* [15 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200315073913/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1239093750409965568): He was made the poster boy for MeToo and prosecuted because they needed to find one body in the wreckage. His trial marks the effective end of me too.

Both can be true.

And he is so despised and obviously disgusting and guilty that it's so much the worse that he ties himself to a legitimate issue, thereby discrediting it.
* [15 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200315011527/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1238994875447640066): I agree with this. I had not even focused much on Weinstein other than some ficus plant jokes until this controversy arose when a few people came out with novelty takes that seemed to be defending Weinstein. IMO he is cynically tying his case to the false rape accusation problem. https://twitter.com/toomuchsandwich/status/1238989359510097920
* [15 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200315005642/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1238992440117395456): I said "he did nothing wrong according to who" and you replied "me." If you were just being hyperbolic in the moment, I get it, But you did say it.
* [15 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200315005107/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1238991050619920386): I can see the concern, but I also think that it needs to be coupled with a clear denunciation of Weinstein and a statement that he is obviously a predator. The confusion has led to some people arguing like sociopaths that the Jewish Hollywood system of transactional sex is A-OK.
* [15 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200315004253/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1238988876825473024): You just said he did nothing wrong.

That's not true in all cases, but it's an odd thing to focus on anyway. Who cares about that? Why should we allow such a system to persist or say that those in charge of it are doing nothing wrong?
* [15 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200315002705/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1238984569631707137): Lol. The women were willing (a dubious claim), therefore I have no problem with Jewish perverts using wealth and power to systematically demand transactional sex.

But it doesn't mean he is not a sexual predator that deserves the Leo Frank treatment.
* [14 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200314235657/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1238977350018236416): Weinstein is clearly guilty of what he was convicted of and more. He used his position to lure women in to have sex with him, sometimes he openly coerced them, he made them watch as he masturbated into house plants and he had them followed by ex-Mossad operatives to silence them.

* [14 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200314235211/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1238976218306838528): If in fact it is true that the Weinstein case has created a new and bad precedent that will be used against white men, which is plausible, though I am not totally convinced, this does not make Weinstein innocent, it just shows how Jews will cynically exploit any situation.
* [14 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200314234828/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1238975102273957888): Rather than appear to defend Weinstein, who everyone knows is guilty, why not explain that Jews are cynically exploiting a case of a widely hated and obviously guilty Jew to make further gains in terms of the kinds of cases they can prosecute.  This way you avoid confusion.
* [14 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200314234223/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1238973657164271617): Would you leave your daughter, sister or wife alone with him? Weinstein is cynically attempting to tie his case to that of the innumerable innocent white men that have fallen victim to capricious courts. I say he can fuck off.
* [14 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200314233732/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1238972531375300608): Do you believe that he is not a rapist and sexual predator, or simply that the prosecution brought a bad case? He was not convicted based on "believe all women" or else why was he acquitted of 3 out of 5 charges?
* [14 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200314233126/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1238970996947910656): And if in fact his case has worked in such a way as to set a bad precedent, which I am not convinced of, because the precedent was already set, then so much more reason to hate him.
* [14 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200314233039/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1238970782195363841): Weinstein's PR people have worked hard to shoehorn this case into the classic feminist false rape charge paradigm, but it doesn't fit. I'm not interested in psychoanalyzing anyone or looking at hidden motivations. I am simply saying he is actually a serial rapist.
* [14 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200314224305/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1238958702465552385): Strauss is a Jew and he is talking to elite Jewish students as a Jew to other Jews. He knows he is talking to members of a new elite, and he is warning them to make sure they leave room for Jewish exclusivity in the new regime they are building.

This is framed as if Strauss is discussing the broad problem of the day as an American. He's not.

* [14 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200314223500/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1238956607633068035): The nineteenth century civil rights advocates and activists were Protestants, Quakers and a few blacks. They were idealistic but unwilling to be coercive and trample on their fellow Americans. In the 1960s they were Jews. They were cynical and cared nothing for rights.
* [14 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200314223252/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1238956110565998594): Christopher Caldwell mentions that what sets the civil rights litigators of the 1960s apart from those of the nineteenth century is a particular genius for wielding power and a willingness to be coercive and trample over rights. I think there's something else at the root of that.
* [14 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200314202123/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1238923166690533377): I'll stick to the assertions and not feel bad about it. Moldbug is an annoying Jewish megalomaniac who writes meandering columns that don't say much and are really only meant to demonstrate his own erudition.

He is brushed off, inb4ed and treated like a crackpot racist. I actually like this. Let these people stay in their echo chamber.
* [14 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200314200601/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1238919129681321984): There has been a brand of obstinate neoliberals that have furiously reacted to the proposition that White Americans are resentful and that they have an actual human case instead of simply being irredeemable racists.
* [14 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200314200335/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1238918691712090115): The job of intellectuals is to study society and report back to elites to let them know what's going on. Given this, it's funny to see the furiously negative reactions of elites to intellectuals like Caldwell and Lind who are trying to tell them why it is that Trump won.
* [14 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200314195704/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1238917050556432384): Asking this question means you don't understand globalism. Of course elites are getting it first. https://twitter.com/DavidVidecette/status/1238487118030258180

Their plan was to make everyone fat lazy consumers enslaved to a debt financing system. No jackboots required or desired. If jackboots appear it's because there has been a serious problem with the plan.
* [12 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200312213357/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1238216591894097922): Identifying this storytelling pattern is a great heuristic for filtering out conspiracy theories that simply reinforce the liberal priors everyone has been conditioned with, and are therefore false, vs those that actually identify and challenge the existing power structure.
* [12 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200312213156/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1238215727494111232): Most NWO conspiracies fall into this pattern. Eventually the grand plan comes to a point where there are jackboots in the streets. These stories reflect the Jewish neuroticism on which our pop culture is based. When people actually want the jackboots, there are none to be found.
* [12 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200312212716/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1238214359073075202): So conspiracy theorists need to update their narratives and rethink the biases on which they are based. Most of them are retellings of the classic Jew/Nazi narrative of an evil dictator using emergency powers to take absolute power and oppress people. They are liberal myths.
* [12 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200312212440/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1238213745064771589): Under liberalism, the government refuses to acknowledge the crisis, tells people to keep shopping and not limit their "freedom" in any way and can't think of solutions outside the debt financed economic model while the people cry out for an authoritarian response.

In classic conspiracy tales, the government induces a false crisis to impose emergency martial law and an authoritarian crackdown on the people. The reality is the opposite under liberalism.

I doubt Jen Greenberg has ever had a working class job. Anyone who has would know how absolutely absurd this tall tale is

They just wrecked the truck for fun. Of course a mini-farm in the bed of a pickup is really fucking stupid anyway, so I can hardly blame them tbh.

Also, you never really get it. You'll find that money as balance due next time you file.

That adds a bit of credibility to it. It's not like one woman you dated years ago can come forward out of nowhere and accuse you and win. That's an extreme exaggeration.
* [12 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200312061703/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1237985695484071938): The courts have been fucking white men for a while. I don't think the Weinstein case makes it any worse, and I don't think a victory for him would ever make it better either. And it's extremely bad optics to appear to be siding with him.

And it's not true. There is a case like that against Trump right now that is going nowhere.  But if you want to talk about white men that are actually innocent getting railroaded, then by all means be my guest.

It's about Weinstein and who he is and what he represents. Weinstein is a wealthy Jew that has given to feminist causes, employed big name feminist attorneys and donated to the ADL his entire life.

Harvey Weinstein is a sick jewish pervert with money and power that uses it to donate to anti-white causes and organizations and puts out degenerate trash movies. Don't side with him. Ever.

Truth is they were both drunk, left a party together, were doing stuff behind the dumpster when she passed out. Two white knights came upon them and accused him.

Perhaps some were both. The question is who sets up the system, and then preys on those that fall into it? The answer is Jews like Frank and Weinstein, who are basically the same.
* [12 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200312000457/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1237892164039790598): So, were those women sluts, or were they responding to bad incentives created by an unjust system?

Rumor was that Frank would have some of his female employees up to his office on a regular basis for a "voluntary exchange" and his black security guard that he tried to blame for Phagan's death would watch the door.
* [12 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200312000057/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1237891222863114240): Obviously not. But was this Mary Phagan's fault? The system creates incentives, and predatory Jews take advantage of that.

* [11 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200311231339/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1237879254727028738): Everyone gets that many of the women that Weinstein abused were careerist sluts. That only becomes a stumbling block if you expect women to have agency or to be good without men making them be so. Even if they're sluts, it doesn't follow that Weinstein doesn't deserve punishment.
* [11 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200311225146/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1237873503879057410): Expose the system itself. Don't simp for a rich Jew that has worked his whole life to fuck you over. White men will be fucked over in any case, If Weinstein got off they would simply be making an unprincipled exception because he's a powerful Jew. It wouldn't apply to you anyway.
* [11 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200311224721/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1237872733171507202): Weinstein was a huge feminist most of his life. Jewish feminists Roberta Kaplan and Lisa Bloom have both been on his payroll. He used to attend the pussy march. The tradeoff was that they would look the other way as he raped white girls, as long as he wasn't caught.
* [11 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200311224515/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1237872208136962052): Women don't really run anything. They successfully leverage accusations against men for money and/or fame because the system as set up by Jews and jewish activist groups that Weinstein gives money to have laid the groundwork for that.
* [11 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200311224227/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1237871506991935491): It's possible for it to be true that Harvey Weinstein is a degenerate Jew that corrupts women and for the women he abused to be fallen sluts at the same time. It's possible to weigh the balance of that and see which is the greater enemy.
* [11 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200311224120/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1237871128166535177): It's a matter of mistaken priorities. People like Weinstein are why women become sluts and why there are unfair legal precedents against men. Going to bat for someone that not only won't go to bat for you, but has actively worked against you his whole life, is just cucking.

The Mueller probe is long past, no reason to nurse a grudge. The fact is that Trump simply isn't doing those kind of politics anymore.

But I don't even buy that. That's the media line on it. Trump placed people in his administration that were total enemies of his before the election, he has been fine making up with people in the past. https://twitter.com/KingKirmudgeon/status/1237586572947550209

Not allowing Iran to strike Israel is different than making Iran a harder target for the US military, thus bolstering the government there which Israel also wants taken out. These are just facts.

Again, go ahead and hate Russia, but if you have to make absurd claims to do it, then you hurt your case.

But neocons and Zionists in the US attack Russia all the time. This is just a fact. So you need to be able to explain that. If you claim that people in the US media attacking Russia are anti-zionists, you are just gonna look dumb.

But I think they also want to conceal the raw ethnic supremacism and bloodthirstyness of the Jewish story.

It is a purely Jewish ethnic supremacist myth. So why did the Jews invent a story of blood libel and murderous revenge, complete with betrayal and sex? It's like their first Hollywood movie.

The name of the Persian king doesn't match with historical records and there are no records of any of these edicts or any extra-Jewish account of this. The Jews invented a story of blood libel and racial revenge.

His ten sons, who were innocent of any crime against the Jews, were executed before him as he watched. After the death of Haman, 75,000 random Persians were killed and the Jews celebrated. No reason is offered for their deaths.

Publicly she was a supporter of Palestinian rights, but it turns out that privately she didn't like Jews and knew the holocaust was fake and said blacks take too much welfare. LMAO.

A tragedy in the latter cases. Highsmith was definitely reclusive and detached, probably why she was ok considering topics verboten in high social circles.

Of course Highsmith had her problems. She was a lesbian, though considering her mother once told her that she tried to abort her by drinking bleach, this fits with a pattern of child abuse leading to homosexuality.

The Jew Albert Lindemann tried to do this with his book Esau's Tears in 1997 and he was lambasted for it.

Lots of people talk about Culture of Critique, but KMac's second book in his series is also very interesting, as it is a serious and unbiased study of gentile antisemitism

The reason is they don't want you in a frame of mind where you think of it as a debate.

The boomers had Steven Spielberg and Schindler's List as their propaganda. A total lie, but "serious" and effective. Today the Jews have the likes of David Weil, Damon Lindelhof and Alex Kurtzman turning out this hamfisted material.

This is a case study in how they co-opt and use any resentment towards the wealthy for their own purposes.

Scapegoating whites, when most of these homes are owned by Jews. 2. Claiming there is a wealth transfer from POC when POC are net tax consumers. 3.

It doesn't have to be a rainbow, perhaps simply a prominently displayed Israeli flag pin. Just so we know who we are listening to.

And it was exacerbated by the fact that he couldn't easily paint him as a kook. So he focused in on Trump, trying to tease out some admission of being a Trump supporter or point to Lind's disagreement with liberal media canon on Trump to discredit him to Jew Yorker readers.

If there is any disbelief it's that any relatively mainstream scholar would say such things in the first place. It doesn't fit the standard kosher sandwich.

He even says that populism is a big problem. His work is interesting because he is accurately diagnosing the problem, something you almost never see coming out of mainstream political scholars.

Lind has complained that basically every liberal that interviews him on his book does this.

Lind points out how patently absurd it is, and Chotiner can barely contain his rage. Lind's book is one of the few interesting recent political works.

That is that America's problems are the result of white racism creating an unfair system and this white racism is somehow in league with big business and Donald Trump is the avatar of this system.

Chotiner is extremely mad about this. His narrative is that Trump is some kind of big business racist

This drives the Jew crazy.

Chomsky's biggest contribution to Zionism has been hoodwinking the white left into thinking that Israel is a pawn of the US rather than vice versa.

So they mean that racism on the part of the dead men was not a factor. Ferris's racial motives are obvious.

Yglesias is a Jew that has an interest in these politics for pragmatic tribal reasons, he doesn't need to ideologically blinker himself like an aspirational white person.

It's pretty hard to claim they don't run it, but hilariously when Jews and only Jews have control of something they use it only for the most innocuous and/or noble purposes.

Actually do what was right and sanction Kaplan 2. Keep me in the case and openly say that Kaplan's unethical behavior was OK. 3. Dismiss me from the case.  He took the path of least resistance. You don't win any points for that.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225025439/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1232136774178267136): And her behavior was obviously unethical on its face. She and to some extent Moon were simply counting on the hapless defendants not having the wherewithal to do anything about it.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225025313/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1232136410787917825): Which is not to imply that any of the arguments I made were unprincipled. They were all totally legally sound, which was the problem. But I wasn't just defending myself, I was going on the attack against Kaplan and asking the court to sanction her for her unethical behavior.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225024917/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1232135423977283585): And let's be honest, Moon granted my motion because my strategy was creating a huge hassle for the court and for the plaintiffs, not out of any principle. If he had principles the entire thing would be tossed out with prejudice and Roberta Kaplan sent packing.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225024731/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1232134977095073792): Some may say that I shouldn't be critical of Norman Moon, because it was Moon that made the  decision to grant my motion to dismiss in the farcical Kaplan et al lawsuit. No. I'll take that relative freedom and criticize him because he deserves it.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225022814/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1232130127192100864): These kind of articles are not published to inform the public. The public doesn't care that a guy was making such comments on his own twitter. This is elite to elite signaling about specific individuals or types of individuals that they want targeted and purged.

Why should I respect a state that openly says it is all about rights and then brazenly tramples on mine? No. Fuck you.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225021128/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1232125904639479808): Make them either respect our rights or come right out in the open and use obviously absurd pilpul to codify tyranny. Make our point that America is dead for us, and put it in writing. Our case that we should not be forced to suffer such a system becomes that much easier.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225020856/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1232125269143621633): Now, given all of this, it is of course still possible and even likely that Moon's decision will stand or be affirmed by a higher court. But that would only underscore the point that the system we live under is fundamentally illegitimate. I say make them go ahead and affirm this.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225020610/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1232124570137702400): There is also the concept of argumentum ad absurdum. The idea that we would have to throw the first amendment in the trash because of qualified immunity is absurd on its face, and must be wrong. Clearly this was never the intent of any founder or framer of law in this country.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225020315/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1232123836813971457): Recently a guy was charged with vandalism for putting up white nationalist posters in a town where other political posters were allowed to remain, even in technically illegal places. The police cracked down on him specifically because of his political views. He won the case.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225020148/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1232123474547814401): The second is equal protection. If the police are consistently refusing to protect only one group while allowing another group to act lawlessly, then they are violating the first amendment rights of the first group. There is precedent on this.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225020025/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1232123123853598720): Reason one is that there are often times in legal cases clashes between certain legal principles, and when that happens the more important principle must take precedence. The First Amendment is clearly more important than qualified immunity, so it must win out.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225015909/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1232122807594704896): Some have argued that the concept of qualified immunity for the police essentially makes Jude Moon's decision to nullify the first amendment in Kessler v. Charlottesville correct. That is wrong for a number of reasons.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225014915/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1232120315687440389): The law also has concepts of weight. So qualified immunity may be a principle, but the first amendment is a higher principle, so if qualified immunity is extended to basically destroy the right to speak and assemble then it has to lose.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225014643/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1232119678836842497): This is a great question that no one is answering.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225014543/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1232119423944839170): Yes, I understand that concept. But there are larger issues at play. That qualified immunity was never meant to create a situation where police didn't have to intervene in literal riots or that they could consistently allow one group to target another and suppress their rights.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225014239/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1232118655145607173): At one point in his decision Moon casts doubt on the entire concept of free speech at all, and whether the protesters ever had a right to assemble in the first place, flying the face of a previous decision by his own court that positively affirmed the right to hold the rally.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225014028/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1232118103607324673): He was put into a position by the lawsuit where he essentially had to openly refute the first amendment. We can just accept it, or we can make as much noise about it as possible.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225013840/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1232117651155144704): Even if you don't like the alt-right or certain individuals involved, it doesn't matter. Judge Moon has basically individually stated that the first amendment is no longer in operation in the US and don't expect any of your rights to be protected by the state.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225013621/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1232117069354803200): This effectively nullifies the first amendment. Since the state can pick and choose which speech it protects and which it doesn't, it can shape public opinion by simply standing down in certain cases and allowing private actors to violate rights.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225013502/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1232116736624930816): The upshot being that if one group assembles for the purposes of expressing free speech rights, and another to violently suppress these rights, the state has no obligation to intervene and is free to allow the attacking group to do whatever they want.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225013341/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1232116397045669888): Moon argues in his opinion that the state has no duty to protect any citizens, and that it is perfectly within their rights to stand down and allow one group of citizens to attack another. They have no inherent duty to intervene, and if they do so it's by their own discretion.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225013101/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1232115725097209856): The Decision of Judge Norman Moon to dismiss the legal complaint of Jason Kessler and Matt Parrott against the city of Charlottesville and certain members of the police and city government has ominous implications for constitutional rights and must be overturned.

Problem is you need something that a mongrelized, high time preference American population will actually watch.

This reflects the change in America's demographics.

The halftime show for years has been about celebrating the death of white America, the imagery of the little immigrant children in cages with American flags was much more notable than a Puerto Rican broad shaking her ass, which is just expected.

(Joe Kennedy was a vocal anti-semite and possibly passed this along to his son.) JFK was obstructing Israel's nuke program and acquisition of nuke materials from the US. He favored a balanced policy towards Israel and the Arabs.

Why does he think that it is not suspicious that Oswald was killed by Jacob Rubenstein? Does he parrot the absurd mainstream line that Rubenstein was a patriot that loved Kennedy so much he murdered Oswald?

It's not. This isn't popular and would never be a thing at all if not for the rich and powerful promoting their social views using the mechanism of capitalism.

In Europe Neoconservatism and Ronald Reagan hold no weight whatsoever, so why would any populist leader give this crap the time of day?

But Tucker, existing in the US political milieu and having to deal with neoconservatism as the dominant force, has an excuse. In Europe where such politics are alien it is very telling.

It hides the fact that tech giants, mostly Jewish run, are deciding on and enforcing a social narrative and it gives the alt-light an acceptable enemy to go after while upholding liberalism

The US itself is willing to sabotage the petrodollar in order to keep a troop presence in Iraq. If the US kills access to that account, then Iraq has no incentive to stay on petrodollars. https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/11/trump-administration-warns-iraq-could-lose-new-york-fed-account-wsj.html

The problem is that anti-Islam sentiment in the conservative mainstream is a bulwark of liberalism and Zionism. Those arguments are a blind alley for whites.

If you don't want more US wars in the Middle East, that means you have to attack the lies and propaganda and the neocon shills producing it.

These are not supersonic ballistic missiles like what Iran fired. These are truck launched rockets, much more likely to have been fired by a militia. The US will ignore this for now.

Iran has delivered hundreds of Fateh 110 missiles, which are the same but have a shorter range, to Hezbollah in Lebanon. They can hit anywhere in Israel.

The Iraqi PM Adil Abdul-Mahdi resigned in Nov. after fake and gay protests instigated by the US. The real implication was clear, resign or be assassinated. The US thought he was too close to Iran.

Yes there are dissidents like there are in any state, but they are few and considered pariahs. Moves like what the US did yesterday further isolate them.

No strike like this is ever carried out as revenge for dead troops. The fact that they have to resort to this shows how thin any arguments about US interests really are.

They knew it was a minefield for them from minute one, but they can brazen through the initial shock by calling anyone that talks about the racial angle a racist. That won't work for long though, so now they have simply stopped reporting on it.

He looks at Jews as if they are just participants in x or y bad trend, rather than the originators of it, or as cynical manipulators of it for their own ends.

When you understand what he calls "radical leftism" this way, the seeming contradictions are cleared up. Jews are always jews before they are anything else, and they tell you this themselves.

He treats left wing Jews just like they are other people under the "radical left" umbrella. He does not see "radical leftism" fundamentally as a Jewish strategy for social domination.

Sargon acknowledges that this is satire in the last minute of this video, but his point is that the article may as well have been real since it presents a coherent version of the "radical left" ideology.

In the US Islam represents no political threat to Jewish power. Neoconservative kvetching that liberals choose muslims over Jews is meant to center the argument in American politics around what is good for the Jews and turn it into a butt goy competition.

He got far more love from the people for saying we should stay the hell out of the middle east than he ever got got for brinksmanship with Iran, so i doubt it.

They're not as smart as they think they are, and their bullshit only works on the uninformed.

And China is a major importer of Iranian oil. You should know what you are talking about before you speak up.

The idea that the present situation is because of "bad blood" is the kind of thing dumb people say when they want to sound smart.

This is also why Netanyahu is in political trouble in Israel.
* [28 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191228193235/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1211007027570528259): It's not wrong to lay this at the feet of Netanyahu and his butt goy Trump either. They took a very grug brained approach to this, when the smarter Jews wanted to pursue the Iran deal and try to open up markets in Iran and undermine the regime from within.

He so desperately wants Jews to be on his side. They're not. Look at the names of the Columbia U. administrators that are more interested in punishing students that make racial comments than in keeping students safe from black and brown predators. https://twitter.com/colinflaherty/status/1210559959793950721

Puerto Ricans and Dominicans are some of the most violent groups in the city. You want to pretend blacks are the only kind of brown person that is habitually violent?
* [27 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191227150036/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1210576195424833538): You got a link for that story?

Yes, groups will seek power, this doesn't mean that it's not better for certain groups to have power than others or that some systems are not better than others.
* [26 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191226235449/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1210348243953049607): You're not analyzing what you are saying. Look at how nihilistic your statement was. Would you resort to that level of nihilism about power systems if we were discussing any other group? As an old friend of mine used to say "Nihilism is easy to start, but hard to finish."
* [26 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191226235050/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1210347245150834690): If I said that the ruling class of our society were Asia-Pacific Islanders, you would simply laugh and call me crazy. Similarly if I said it were blacks. But with Jews, you have to engage in all kinds of mental backflips. Think about it.
* [26 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191226234841/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1210346701766180864): Because the identity of Jew is how and why they wield power. You cannot analyze it and eschew that fact, and the only reason you want to is to avoid the repercussions of actually challenging power. Would you do these kind of mental gymnastics on behalf of any other group?
* [26 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191226234439/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1210345688011362304): If you want to continue to find a way to put the moral burden on me for opposing an objectively unfair and morally repugnant power system and continue to let them off the hook you could say that.
* [26 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191226234003/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1210344528743452672): Jews are the referees of the identity claims of other groups, which effectively makes them the ruling class in our society. Understanding this and using that knowledge to make sense of what goes on is far more explanatory than whatever system you are using.
* [26 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191226233511/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1210343305260781571): So women calling men sexist is as you said highly inconsistent in terms of results. But only if you view it from the angle that it would be consistent based on past marginalization or people actually giving a fuck. It's not. It's consistent based on who is actually in power.
* [26 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191226233305/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1210342778737221639): No. I wouldn't say that. The ability to use identity claims to flex is limited by the rank of various identities on the power stack, with Jews at the top and white men so far at the bottom that even asserting an identity is enough to destroy you.
* [26 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191226233016/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1210342069203550209): This critical milieu is a result of noticing these patterns of abuse of power over and over and seeing them get away with it due to weak excuses. I think your defensive reaction is limiting to you.
* [26 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191226232238/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1210340149248364545): Think about it. Think about the kind of protection Jewishness and the ability to label others antisemite gives you. Since as you say, there are awful people in the world, explain to me why they would not exploit this, and why Jews would not cultivate this system of power.
* [26 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191226231939/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1210339397222178817): But again, that's not the point. I'm not saying there aren't other awful people. I am saying that Jewish nepotism creates a shield around their awful people, and it is enhanced by the fact that mentioning it earns you the social and financial ostracism of being labeled antisemite
* [26 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191226231646/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1210338671855054848): Louis CK is Jewish.

But I never said there were no non-Jewish perverts. That would be absurd. I said that Jewish nepotism is what creates consistent patterns of abuse and escape from culpability. It's a pattern with them, not one guy maybe getting away with it.

Don't agree with me on that? Ask the Jews themselves. They agree, they just don't expect you to read this. https://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/246724/the-specifically-jewy-perviness-of-harvey-weinstein

In theory there may be some issue with sexual harassment absent Jewish nepotism, but that is the issue that makes it an epidemic in Jewish dominated fields (Hollywood and Journalism) and creates consistent patterns of abuse.
* [26 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191226225127/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1210332299121831941): Give me some examples of problems punishing these people where Jews are not involved.

* [26 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191226224204/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1210329939905515521): I mean, look at this man and tell me you don't see the spitting image of The Chairman of the Board. I don't see any of Woody Allen in this man's face. If he were Woody Allen's son, he would be molesting women himself rather than trying to get justice for abused women. pic.twitter.com/OQYjEIv2Wn

* [26 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191226223627/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1210328524156002304): In fact, Jewish feminists initially came to the defense of the powerful Jews that were getting accused of sexual misconduct. Weinstein's first lawyer in this scandal was Lisa Bloom, a Jewish feminist that helped get Bill O'Reilly fired form Fox.
* [26 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191226223418/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1210327984089059328): But  was not kicked off by Jewish feminism, it was kicked off by Ronan Farrow, who is the son of Frankie Blue Eyes and Mia Farrow. No one really believes he is the son of Woody Allen. And his desire to vicariously punish his scumbag "father" was part of his motivation.
* [26 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191226221515/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1210323189269704704): Without the ethnic issue, this is not a problem. Jewish nepotism is what creates a problem in punishing sex pests. The "good ol boys" network is not a "good ol goys" network.

The other journo named in this article isn't Jewish, but is one of the top SJW butt goys in the field. The trouble is that the issue is bound up with the ethnic question, and that is the only thing that confounds justice in such cases.
* [26 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191226220652/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1210321078901448705): If the victim were Jewish, the attack would have been covered up quickly, categorized as an anti-semitic attack and Judge Goldstein and public defender Kaplan would be trying to put the perps away rather than get them off.

What does it matter if I "fault" them or not? Who cares? It's irrelevant. Jews having power is bad for me and mine, so I want them to have less power. Show me the gap in my logic.

And read up on literally every Jewish holiday. Find one where the celebration of the killing of non-Jews doesn't play at least some role. And have a Merry Christmas.

It's not an issue of faulting them or not. I expect Jews to try to increase their own power. I don't want them to have power. Simple as.

The choice of Hanukkah was a flex. The themes are Jewish supremacy, non-integration with gentiles and, like all other Jewish holidays, murdering non-Jews that happen to live near Jews.

But all of them are or were professors at elite institutions. This is an intra-elite dispute where older, more serious liberal intellectuals are warning the NYT that it's going full retard.
* [24 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191224213855/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1209589269427347456): They're gonna get eviscerated by the WSWS too. The issue is that this is effectively an internal dispute. Far left historians are warning the Times it is losing credibility.

They defended Dominique Strauss Kahn when he assaulted a hotel maid several years ago. The reasoning is that right wing moral panic is the bigger threat

But it's interesting that their criticism gets a hearing. The WSWS is a predominantly Jewish, Trotskyist organ that is offering a friendly warning to the NYT that they risk discrediting themselves.
* [24 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191224212654/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1209586246172991488): FWIW their criticism is pretty much correct, that the 1619 Project is fake history driven by elite ideological concerns. It's a transparent attempt to make "white supremacy" and the "struggle" against it the dominant theme of American history.

Why is the New York Times engaging in an argument with the WSWS, a miniscule Trotskyist publication run by like 10 Jews in NYC and Ann Arbor? I mean, it's better than the NY Times by far, but then so is pretty much anything. Why does this group get a response?  https://twitter.com/nhannahjones/status/1208130397072179201

Try actually reading the source material instead of watching anime and taking bong rips all day. Or just embrace your status as a degenerate lumpenprole. IDGAF. But you're making a fool of yourself.

According to him transsexuals were deviants and categorized as part of the lumpenproletariat along with criminals and drug users. These groups orient towards the ruling class and are used by them as a bulwark against workers.

Please explain how a decadent sexual fetish/lifestyle choice that is typically associated with degenerate elites is in any way bound up with the struggle of workers for rights, wages and living conditions?

Calling it "far right propaganda" is just another slogan that further proves my point that your ideology is based in arbitrary definitions and categorizations rather than material and class analysis.

It is actually looking at the political and class orientation of certain bourgeois hobbyist groups and making the exact point that they are liberal and not leftist. This bruises the ego of internet radlibs, but it's the truth.
* [24 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191224182540/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1209540637911060481): I mean, we can say liberals are not leftists. I agree. But without a material and class analysis of certain political groups and tendencies this is not very interesting. Are bourgeois radlib tendencies like DSA leftist? Are homosexual movements leftist? Clearly not.

They shot up the market due to some criminal dealings gone wrong that the Jews were involved in. The media wants to cover that up and find an anti-semitic angle.

It will be tough for them to make that case, but it's great when they are put in the position of having to make untenable arguments.

He is a Jewish ethnic activist that uses his money, power and connections to advance the interests of his tribe at the expense of the goyim. That is how people need to look at him.

They are also financial  backers of LGBT activism. Bernie Marcus is a top funder of TPUSA. So if you wonder why Charlie Kirk promotes homosexuality, there is your answer.

Praising Henry Ford and then launching into a diatribe about how Paul Singer's business practices are hollowing white American towns. Jews heard the messages loud and clear.

Having seen the DC conservative scene firsthand a couple years ago, however briefly, I can say that it was exactly as he described.
* [27 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127063316/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1199573202915254274): The funny thing is, they LARP as an aloof and out of touch elite without even being elite. They are mostly middle class people scraping by for not even very good salaries.

They have drinks and go to parties and discuss the latest article in this or that magazine. And none of it makes a bit of difference, and they don't care. They get to wear a club tie at parties and topsiders to go boating on the weekend. That's what matters.

They are not focused on policy. At all. They hardly care about it. It's a social club.

Their job is to specifically NOT talk about them. It makes their political writings dumb and boring, but it's a paycheck.
* [27 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127063332/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1199567254842695685): The snark is a defense mechanism here, and the fact that these supposed Catholics are not treating a group of young men that are expressing interest in their religion with charity, but with scorn is very revealing.

His anti-David Frenchism only gos so far. Exploring the role of Jews in the sexual revolution is definitely off the table.

What happens to this guy's job at the NY Post if he utters a critical word about Zionism? What happens to his social standing in DC circles?

Yet we are supposed to believe that these obvious material truths about life must be left out of politics, and that doing so is not only smart, it is virtuous. In reality, it's just cowardice.
* [27 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127053817/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1199558962091380736): The flippant remark that it's some hidden gnosis further obfuscates the issue. It's not hidden. It's something real that people live every day. It's not hidden, it is deliberately suppressed, backed with economic and social penalties.
* [27 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127053817/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1199558962091380736): It is not particularly smart to leave racial and ethnic group differences out of a political analysis. Ahmari only pretends it is, and only when white people do it, because this is the elite consensus, imposed from above and backed by threat of ostracism and economic penalties.
* [27 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127053817/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1199558962091380736): I thought at the very least that Catholics were supposed to be charitable to one another. This is an uncharitable take that should be beneath this guy. It also perpetuates the conceit that intentionally *not* taking racial and ethnic group differences into account is super smart. https://twitter.com/SohrabAhmari/status/1199522251449737216

Even your above statement contains historical errors that you could avoid even if you read Jones's works. Your claim about expulsion is false.

If you are theorizing that being Catholic would have somehow prevented the outcome we see today, you are dealing in counterfactuals so unlikely as to be meaningless.

Just from a pragmatic standpoint it's a bad argument that sounds like the same crap whites have been hearing from people that hate us. I have respectfully told Dr. Jones that I don't think he is winning anyone over with this argument.

I am just saying that I don't think he has completely adopted that narrative of Dr. Jones, and if he did he would stop attracting people. Telling people not to identify as white just sounds really bad. Objectively it's going to lose people.
* [26 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191126062754/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1199210622115864577): So if your argument is pragmatic, then the Boer already had a very strong Christian and ethnic identity and what happened was because of international plots against them and their relative small size compared to blacks. I would try another example.
* [26 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191126062754/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1199210622115864577): Given the history, the resentment the Boer have for Anglos is understandable. The Boer are also extremely Christian, though not Catholic, they are very strongly religious.

South Africans actually identify more strongly and Boer. Boer and Anglo distinctions are very salient there. They prevented SA and Rhodesia from uniting when they were both being attacked by the same forces. Unifying as white would have helped.

But the group of people that own the media didn't like him, so they used their power to shatter public confidence. Now the media is just a shitshow that everyone hates.

All other iterations of cancel culture flow from the original cancel culture promoted by William F. Buckley in the 1950s when he purged pro-whites and those critical of Jewish power from conservatism. https://twitter.com/PoliteRightSide/status/1198671929068150785

People hate this sort of thing. So why does the Sun publish it?

Only Jews have an interest in this sort of thing. Immigration is a racial problem, it is not a problem because muslims don't like people burning their holy book.

Cohen will never be affected by any hate speech law.

But it's not. Cohen's humor is the height of political correctness. All his targets are groups hatted by Jews and attacked in the media and by the intelligentsia.

He was making fun of country whites. All his skits are making fun, usually in a very nasty way, of various groups hated by Jews. This is important to understand. https://twitter.com/KirkegaardEmil/status/1198380773218357248

Moral zeal and solidarity can win if we can see our way to taking our own side and having the utmost moral confidence. Years of cynical Jewish propaganda were designed precisely to attack that moral confidence.

Showing up in person in the area to defend him and flooding the local and county cops with calls to tie up their communications. Admirable.

The problem for the establishment, which Dave may not realize, is that given greater freedom our views would explode in popularity. Dave is still a sheltered NYC Jew and may not get this.

* [23 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191123061358/https://twitter.com/MikePsJuice/status/1198067175908618241): Dave Smith, a libertarian Jewish comic, lays out some of the basic grievances of young white men today. This proves that our ideas are really not so scary that Jews can't engage with them honestly, he isn't saying anything lots of other Jews don't know. So why is he doing it? https://twitter.com/CaucasianRandom/status/1197942628580392960

Look at what Cringeshaw wants to spend money on vs. Barnie Sandlers. Zioclops gets his way more often, with money going to war and Israel rather than the kind of domestic programs that Sandlers talks about.

Fact is that the federal government is not constrained by the need to balance budgets, the huge national debt makes this painfully obvious, yet both parties pay lip service to "balanced budget" rhetoric.

We just can't afford what the other side wants! Then they pretend to own the other side when they want to spend money.
