I dont always know when the occasional nazi walks in just like you guys dont know when the black supremacists walk in. Theres a bunch of them. If I ever see someone come to our rally with a nazi flag, I'll push them out.

I support their right to free speech and to wave that Democrat flag if they want to I just wont be around if they do. I'd never fly a rebel flag. It's a democrat battle flag. It's not my heritage. pic.twitter.com/AsKe9fKUFJ

I've got nothing for racists. I wont even go to a rally where I know a rebel flag will be flying. I'd like to put ALL racists in a room together so they could all kill each other.

A white supremacist? He doesnt look white. He looks Asian. He came there. I haven't seen him before or since. I cant believe your narrative because your narrative has me labeled as a racist, white supremacist, nazi.

After a discussion with one in particular he said "that's how I feel". Young kid. I felt sorry for him. Probably being raised by a shitty mom with no dad in the picture. That's just speculation tho. Anyway... got one of em thinking ;)

I've gone up against the 4th largest army in the world. Antifa ain't shit. Half the people on the right are veterans and half of those are combat veterans. Antifa is climbing a very tall dangerous mountain. Dont drink the koolaid.

New England proud boys cant disavow anyone. I disavow the new england proud boys then lol. See how that works? You'll never find 1 proud boy that's met me in person that wont vouch for me. I never see NEPBS at rallies. Fuck what they think.

If you blow real hard on your thumb, maybe a penis will pop out and you can be a real proud boy and not just a groupie. It's worth a shot. FYI. no one needs Enriques permission to be a proud boy. Antifa could start a chapter if they wanted to. You will NEVER be one tho.

No one touched me and no one really tried to restrict my movement. Just a couple times. Overall it was good. Violence is never the answer. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. I dont make the rules. pic.twitter.com/j0SnNkQcwn

Cops watch everything I do at these rallies. They see who makes first contact. That's why you only see Antifa arrested. Antifa always attacks first. They're too stupid to keep their hands to themselves. I'm teaching life lessons.

They're lured into a false sense of security. It would take at least 5 times their numbers to take us. You aren't dealing with soy boys on the right side. Half of us are combat vets.
