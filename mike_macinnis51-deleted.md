* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828225116/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299479576788123648): Now ban malt liquor . . .

* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828213558/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299460533314150400): Black Lives Matter and Antifa are the equivalent of rabid dogs. But the dogs are morally innocent. The same remedy, however, exists for both. And it can't come soon enough.
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828202458/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299442685544030208): There will always be a major role for small, secure cells. I spent the better part of three years in Northern Ireland in the early 1980s, so I understand this from experience.
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828201043/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299439174064332800): You are correct on both counts, Sir.
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828200926/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299438879066316802): Good suggestions.

* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828200714/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299438335564247040): Good for you!
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828200734/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299438263770451968): When injustice is being done, White men must protect each other from the reach of the authorities. In the Old West, they used to break men out of jail if local law enforcement was corrupt (and it often was). There are things we can learn from those more civilized times.
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828184400/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299417221127602192): I'm afraid he is about to learn just how deeply corrupt the American legal system has become.
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828184207/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299416924607176709): Legal, lawful, and moral self defense is the key.
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828184138/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299416635510591489): Yes, it's all about knowing your local AO. But that doesn't mean you can't organize in a larger sense. There is profit in both, if you know what you're doing.
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828183900/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299416102229901312): Of course, but most people, probably 90%, would be part of a support group to raise awareness of problems, give logistical support, etc. Everything above board and legal. I'm no newcomer to this game, Sir.
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828183622/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299415476888637442): They've known who I am and what I think for a long time now. But they still don't know everything I do, or plan to do. And besides, who can be against "civil defense?" It's a long-standing American idea. Legal and lawful.
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828183309/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299414619409309702): Yes, I see your point. But big, public organizations which provide logistics and support can serve as a shield or mask for smaller groups that are more "active."
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828183122/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299414198141808640): Of course, you have a great history with men like Michael Collins, Tom Barry, et al.
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828183021/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299413865881579520): Eventually, those two obstacles will have to be overcome if we are to survive.
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828180513/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299407653765083136): I know you would, Sir!
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828180022/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299406198148481024): That is bullshit.
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828175821/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299405741720100864): Unless you want your children to become White-hating Bolsheviks, keep them away from public schools, colleges, and universities. In fact, teach them at home. Really all a child needs to learn is to read, write, and do arithmetic. The rest he will pick up as he is interested.
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828175458/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299404992474804224): If there was a White Civil Defense Force, would you join it?
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828174857/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299403487692779521): That season's always open, and there's no bag limit.
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828174442/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299402415892869121): He had a song named for him, if I'm not mistaken . . .
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828174422/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299402290323881984): If one hair on Kyle Rittenhouse's head is harmed, I can assure you there will be hell to pay.
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828173607/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299400203158446081): Yes indeed, that was quite a day in the streets of Charlottesville!
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828173259/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299399448439566339): Yes indeed, Sir.
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828173210/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299399163206008832): In reality, Antifa needs to police to protect them from us nationalists. I've seen them face-to-face and up close, and they didn't stand a chance against us, even when they had superior numbers.
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828172743/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299398100235116544): Kyle Rittenhouse could have protected Rand Paul and his wife from BLM/Antifa . . .
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828171121/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299394083555688449): They have been turned over to reprobate minds. They are in the process of destroying themselves. After that, hell awaits . . . Not much of a future for them.
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828170952/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299393604213899264): When the Democrats come back into power, and they will, they will be the first party to use the power of the federal government to literally destroy their enemies. Get ready for it. And for the purpose of full disclosure, I'm not a Republican. I'm a White/Southern nationalist.
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828170436/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299392322199670785): I've been on board with that since this shit began. It will put a stop to it. As someone once said, dyin' ain't much of a livin'.
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828030927/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299182048553230337): And soon, I believe.
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828030147/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299180267085602817): If one largely untrained, but skilled, 17-year-old young White man can cause this much fear & angst among BLM/Antifa and their supporters, think what 1,000 trained, skilled, experienced, and dedicated White men could accomplish. Maybe that's coming together right now, who knows?
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828025752/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299179254911889409): I think it's coming, sooner rather than later. We'll see.
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828025443/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299178465585889280): It is being negotiated, as I understand things. Nick Sandmann from Covington, KY.

* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828014653/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299161308978229248): So, I hear there's not much going on so far in Kenosha tonight. It's remarkable how one 17-year-old with a battle rifle can make BLM and Antifa rethink their street strategy. It focused their minds quite nicely on the inherent dangers of White opposition.
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828014213/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299160254526009344): HaHa! Ain't that the truth!

* [27 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200827232735/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299126313383391234): This will put great fear into the hearts of BLM and Anitfa and their supporters. They'll know that from now on blood may be required of them when they venture into the streets. Hail Kyle!
* [27 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200827232500/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299125735890673665): Now that 3 commie thugs have been justifiably shot in the streets, the rest of them will now think twice before venturing out to loot and burn American cities and towns. And that's a good thing. If blood has to flow to restore civilized order, let it flow in torrents. Hail Kyle!
* [27 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200827231111/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299122138377453569): I heard someone say after Kyle Rittenhouse shot the commie thugs: "There is now blood in the streets." Our blood, White blood, has already been in the streets for too long now. Black on White violent crime. It's about time it was mingled with the blood of our enemies. Hail Kyle!
* [27 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200827230518/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299120796095275008): by force. Either way, this will lead to blood in the streets."--From a well-placed source of intelligence, regarding the November election
* [27 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200827230518/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299120796095275008): "There will be the risk of total chaos, for neither side will accept a loss. The Democrats are pushing a Socialist agenda, & they will no longer accept defeat. Likewise, there are those on the opposite side who won't stand for the policies of the Democrats they intend to impose
* [27 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200827224010/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299114328042303488): Yep, that's exactly what those gutless cowards in the GOP will do. When given the chance to support the right thing, they always end up supporting the left.
* [27 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200827223400/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299112889693872128): They are our deadly enemy, pure and simple.

* [27 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200827222515/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299110541332365314): This should be interesting. Major compliance in the big cities and some suburbs. Resistance, some major, in the small cities and towns and rural areas. I know traditional Texans pretty well.
* [27 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200827222125/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299109625132773376): No mercy! No surrender! No quarter asked and none given! That should be our nationalist battle cry. These people want us all dead.
* [27 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200827221938/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis51/status/1299109175838998528): He still has a resisting arrest charge against him, at the very least. Wonder if that charge will be served on him?
