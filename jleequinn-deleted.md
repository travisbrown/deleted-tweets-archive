At some point when are people long to behave like actual Anarchists & embrace personal responsibility for one’s actions? If you all insist on crashing their events, to ‘shut it down,’ & then up each side ups the ante from fists, to knives, to then a gun...

Press is beaten, people sprayed etc. the answer is simple:  Hold different spaces. Mr. Ngo is not the reason Antifa groups keep launching counter..

When the PB held a rally, Antifa scheduled theirs. The PBs moved their event to another park. Some Leftists came anyway. August 22 2021 the same. PB move their rally 12 miles away..

Compare WiSpa riots of 7/3 and 7/17 to when the Left held its own event on 7/31. What happened that date when we were there ? Nothing. Because it’s not the Right crashing the Left’s events. There’s an easy solution here & it was...

Mr. Ngo tells 1 side, as an adversary to Antifa aligned groups. But how does that facilitate violence ? Isn’t it Antifa groups showing up to the Right’s events that precipitated all those individuals...

I indicated look at the bushes. It does look like shooter is physically contacted. But is it the other guy? And yes. I made it clear the PBs went .8 miles out of their way to find the Black Bloc- Was Azar assault prior or after ?

Trust goes 2 ways. You blocked Me Chad.  2. Yet you ripped & stole 2 of my vids & posted them, one to smear journo  @MaranieRae  who was attacked.  3. Your post of me on 8/22 libeling me 'Embedding w his Proud Boys friends' is False. Please retract all.    https://twitter.com/chadloder/status/1430397127402786818  pic.twitter.com/5v4cdyFvVc

"Heads up!" A dozen of us indie journos band together in a mini-mall lot. What's amazing is that I only knew 1 person within this crowd to be a conservative and that person is still a registered Dem. Bloc doesn't care. They chuck cans as we keep moving away. pic.twitter.com/oBHe9IKVZS

Andrew  @hungryghosts161  also has targeted me with hate. They think if you’re Asian and don’t accept their party line without researching on your own, you’re somehow ‘right wing.’ Stand down you maniacs.  I never embed with ANY GROUP.

I’m a reporter that belongs to Nobody. And please tell Chad HE tipped me to this case because he said there was a Nazi infiltrator involved. My question was if this alleged person was connected to the PB s ! https://twitter.com/jleequinn/status/1429805299741859842

They, especially the Leftist black bloc embedded ‘Press’ at these things will NOT tell you it of  @SocalAntifa ’s role in organizing “no safe space for fascist” counter action. ie. WiSpa Did you miss this one too ? https://twitter.com/jleequinn/status/1428799151609769986

Neither person in that exchange is ID’d.  No hospitalization. Victim showed 2 gouge wounds.  Beware false Twitter info. pic.twitter.com/AP9vuOGVVz

Yet  @DavidNeiwert  misses a key distinction.  The stabbing victim still in the hospital was actually knifed by Antifa black bloc.

Description: Head to toe in all Black.  @SocalAntifa  'counter protest' group. Shows up w knife in Black Bloc calling for "NO SAFE SPACE" for GOP protesters on 8/15.

I denounce ALL of it. Even the consenting portion needs to be sanctioned elsewhere. Time for Antifa & Proud Boys to take their political beefs to the ring ! Chad knows.  https://twitter.com/chadloder/status/1426952554223525898

Where is the error in showing my whole video from my perspective. And NOT making a conclusion. Also wheres ur post on this little matter?

But you're right. Antifa organizer  @ChadLoder  tends to call everybody a Proud Boy which confuses the issue a lot. Sad thing is  @blatherat   @HuffPost  don't disclose Chad & others are Antifa when they quote them.

One side will continue a march to violence w/o ever seeing the facts. How?  If u search a new journalist, that all your mutuals have labeled to discredit, u see their posts 1st

And is there a detail on the sunglasses ?   @ChadLoder  what are the expressed  pronouns for the blond, tall, White   @socalantifa  assailant who stabs the Hispanic Patriot brawler in blue ?  * This is a serious question for SoCal Antifa / Chad Loder pic.twitter.com/zM48MSVU7j

They attacked the photojournalist 2 or 3 times as the situation turned chaotic quickly.

What I do agree with @stephenehorn on, however, is that furthering the physical confrontation does not work to your advantage. It never does.  I wonder. Would instead removing his mask to expose the ID of your attacker been a more legally sound move ?

Cedar's Sinai (Vishal, a question for you too.) Was the woman who you mentioned showing up to actively seek Cancer treatment for an appointment that day- or was she aligned with the Leftist group that approached to confront the protest of AntiVaxers?

Usually I ask.  But I noticed the effort in the vid of protestors 7/17 to say it's not 'about Transgender' but about children & stopping pedophilia. Activists claim that= AntiTrans. How do you respond?

The political violence of unilateral attacks by Black Bloc we saw on families with kids in Portland yesterday. WiSpa 7-3. Sacramento 12-6. SF 10-17. Can Antifa influencers put a stop to this hatred ?

Let’s loop in  @splcenter   @MargaretLHuang . This was the same litany  @michaelehayden  gave. Antifa attacks like Portland yesterday & LA. These are strike 1st no?

The left is more violent as initiators. They're both terrible. That's based on what I have witnessed over the last 14 months.

I am commenting on why ACLU should come to conclusions independent of whether they match right wing talking points.

It looks very bad. The footage clearly shows a PD cruiser running somebody over. Of course there is context. But the end result is so heinous, the context of the cruiser being trapped may mean little given the late start to this planned action- pic.twitter.com/FAqXOIcmn0

As AC, an anarchist insider from the midwest told me, it's all a framework of 33 years of organizing.
