Maybe she‚Äôs racist, but that video issn‚Äôt evidence she is or was.  And the Floyd bit is strong evidence she isn‚Äôt and probably wasn‚Äôt.  The whole thing is absurd based on my reading of that one article.  Tragic all the way around.

You did what politicians do: sent press releases. You didn‚Äôt do anything at all and certainly less than the average frustrated and bankrupt businessman. What prevents this from happening again? Certainly not you legislators.

She claimed there was ‚Äúno‚Äù fraud. When you pointed out there was documented fraud, she claimed that‚Äôs not what she meant.  Okay. That‚Äôs fine. But why attack Jeff when he was right?

By ‚Äúdefending Gavin,‚Äù do you mean pointing out he‚Äôs not a racist? And where in that article did it say it‚Äôs who he wants? And he has zero control over the organization and is not a member. I‚Äôm not sure what point you‚Äôre making.

There‚Äôs a reason it surges when Vitamin D is difficult to get from the sun.  Mountains of recent science on Vitamin D and Covid.

If the  @AP  and  @FoxNews   call states before the votes are counted, that's good.  Am I doing this right?
