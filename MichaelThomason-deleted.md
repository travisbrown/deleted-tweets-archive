They couldn’t even get the politicians to show up for this.  But, most popular President ever!  Does anyone seriously believe this bs? https://twitter.com/robreiner/status/1387749033897168898

Watch the first two minutes of the first video in this playlist to get a real life example of how this could end.   #ChessDramaBestDrama  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSwm32hsWAtT21Uo4bD5dFmVfNsV0ovvJ

That’s new are and fair use. Filing BS DMCA takedown orders can cost big...

Not sure who said it. Probably applies to more social networks.
* [15 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210415080415/https://twitter.com/MichaelThomason/status/1382605620151476225): Also, doesn’t matter whose channel it was streamed or whose camera was used. Imagine if you were creating a song together, but one of you is claiming sole ownership because you provided the paper.  The paper isn’t the work. The channel isn’t the work. The camera isn’t the work.

Even though you may have copyright ownership, Eric probably has the same ownership. I’d suggest working together or lawyering up.  IANAL, but I’ve actually read the law, which puts me ahead of about 99% of them.   #ChessDramaBestDrama

Monies earned from this joint work, created without a formal agreement, must be shared.  Eric, if you edit the stream, to make a new art, like only showing the salty parts of Hikaru, you would not have to share profits.  Hikaru, bogus DMCA...

You can use that material without...

We never learn. https://youtu.be/0t1Ng1mOEY0
* [13 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413150436/https://twitter.com/MichaelThomason/status/1381986545402531840): Aside from the marketing aspect, I’ll never understand the vaccine proponents that view unvaccinated as malicious.  Seriously, if you got the vaccine, and you believe in it, than what the fuck do you care?
* [13 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413150055/https://twitter.com/MichaelThomason/status/1381985569635508226): That doesn’t mean I’m going to take an experimental drug for a meme virus that requires a test to recognize.  I can understand the selling of the vaccines. That doesn’t make me a buyer, or in this case, a volunteer test subject.
* [13 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413145415/https://twitter.com/MichaelThomason/status/1381983901913088005): An often overlooked part of the vaccine debate that is the size and scale of the business. Vaccines are a major, and important, US export.  I understand the media promoting vaccines, and view the grief directed at people like Alex, in that context. https://twitter.com/alexberenson/status/1381956629189525507

That's a joke or money laundering.  The mods need better guidance; or, the bullion, coins, and paper money categories should be removed. https://www.facebook.com/groups/364657754359187/

I'm sure the policy is to prevent money laundering. pic.twitter.com/v4x5jHIPdU

How much effort should I put into returning the futon pickup voucher from the noreply email?
* [ 5 February 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210205034601/https://twitter.com/MichaelThomason/status/1357535850452692992): Can you guess which one sends email from noreply@em.biglots.com?

Everyday I get unexpected offers.  Today I received a Valentine week trip to a resort in Cancun and a pickup ticket for a futon  @BigLots  in MI.

Was getting the message that Google "couldn't find your Google Accounts."  Glad to see that there are 100k other people here with similar issues.  Time to double check my other accounts recovery options, and find a fallback plan.

And Twitter censored the post!  But DRUMPF is a superuber authoritarianisms! Indict him!!!  BTW, it's not a democracy. I'd expect the former head of the FUCKING CIA to know that. What a clown.

The election of Donald Trump was the closest thing to a transfer of power in the US since Kennedy was shot  2. It wasn't peaceful  3. Trump has tweeted everyday for 4 yrs that doesn't have control of the government  Cry more! https://twitter.com/JohnBrennan/status/1336783198114762753

"Break things..." like their API, six months after you implement it.  Everything good about computing came from breaking up AT&T. https://twitter.com/MichaelThomason/status/1336781719471525891
* [ 9 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201209211633/https://twitter.com/MichaelThomason/status/1336781719471525891): And fucking YouTube is the creepy postal carrier that goes through your mail.  When the video streaming service got so big that they started to pick & choose which videos they would stream to you, they certified  $GOOGL  as a monopoly.  Break them up into 26 bitesize pieces.
* [ 9 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201209210443/https://twitter.com/MichaelThomason/status/1336778738495860740): Why do I suspect that every mail-in Joe Biden vote is as authentic as this shill account? pic.twitter.com/zzgLnvpxzF

We heard time and again, that if Trump is elected, people are going to leave the country. It never happened. They are still coming.  Prediction: if Joe Biden is certified as President, 200 million people will flee this country in four yrs.  Screencap this.

That's what you are crying for?  That's what you really want?   #crybabyTrump
* [ 9 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201209201826/https://twitter.com/MichaelThomason/status/1336767068323143687): Trump points out the obvious.  Joe Biden didn't get 80 million votes.  He couldn't get five people to show up to a rally.  And 100k people take to Twitter to cry about it.  BTW, no one reads your tweets.  You are crying alone.   #crybabyTrump
* [ 3 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201203171939/https://twitter.com/MichaelThomason/status/1334544287653113857): @StackExchange  How do you delete your account?

I also believe we should start allowing bars and restaurants to stay open until 4AM, since they’ve had to deal with do much bs. https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1331837982433812480

Just wondering, is this self-censorship or automated censorship by the GOOG servers?

They want the discussion to go only one way.  I believe people should discuss it while watching.  So disheartening that a news corporation works this way.
* [12 September 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200912225421/https://twitter.com/MichaelThomason/status/1304916204373639170): Science is the new religion. It’s all based on belief.

Then, let individuals choose what they want to read or watch.  That's freedom.  If you don't like that, you shouldn't be working at a *public* company in the US.  FB, GOOGL, TWTR, and YouTube are not private.
* [23 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200823032012/https://twitter.com/MichaelThomason/status/1297372925620899846): Laura Loomer, who was removed from every social media service, will be elected to the US Congress.  This is because, nobody cares about the opinion of the lost souls running these companies.  Think they do? Write a book.  Run for Congress.  Nazis burn books.  Nazis censor others.
* [23 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200823031417/https://twitter.com/MichaelThomason/status/1297371305138888704): If you are running a social media company, and you think someone gives a flip about your opinion, then create an account, and make a post.  Write a book, and watch how no-one reads it.  Nobody cares at all.  That's the lesson of this election.  Nobody cares what you think.
* [23 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200823031106/https://twitter.com/MichaelThomason/status/1297370577133547520): A lesson that used to be taught in every graduate school:  Nobody cares what you think.   @jack , no-one cares what you think.   @TeamYouTube , no-one ever asked you for your opinion.  These rest of your lost souls running "social" companies... no-one ever asked you for your opinion.

That is NOT PRIVATE OWNERSHIP.  These are PUBLIC Companies!  Stop using doublespeak to promote ideals that no-one would ever agree to.
* [23 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200823030540/https://twitter.com/MichaelThomason/status/1297368063894069249): More doublespeak:   The idea that Twitter  $TWTR , Google  $GOOGL , YouTube, or Facebook  $FB , are PRIVATE companies is complete NONSENSE. These are PUBLIC Companies!   Just ask Sergey Brin or Larry Page, who lost control of "their" company.  Ask  @jack , who was fired from Twitter.
* [23 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200823025342/https://twitter.com/MichaelThomason/status/1297366257105338368): The new doublespeak or newspeak:   There's nothing social about distancing...
