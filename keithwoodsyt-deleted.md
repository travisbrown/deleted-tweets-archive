Your only argument to the contrary is that China could use poz to weaken a competitor. No one disputes that

Maybe the billions the CIA put into funding the New Left and creating cultural hegemony over it had some role? Yes, the USA trades with illiberal countries while working hard to poz them through the back door. China doesn't do the latter

Consciousness is the only thing that can't be questioned. Asking for proof of it is absurd. As for 2), I've already listed the many problems materialism introduces

The only thing we have immediate knowledge of is consciousness and the physical world exists in consciousness. Consciousness has ontological primacy over whatever other substance you are trying to construct.

Qualia have a qualitative aspect to that can't be given a complete account of by equating them to the physical processes that create them.

No.

And ontological materialism obviously comes with a host of conclusions relevant to epistemology, ethics and our place in the universe. If materialism is true there can be no truth, no hierarchy, no objective good, no objective standard of beauty etc. etc.

I discovered him through a book called 'The Holographic Universe' though I'll admit when I read Bohm himself I was lost. He was actually much influenced by AN Whitehead's philosophy of panpsychism though, which I mentioned earlier

In any case, if you agree that conscious experience is not wholly reducible to physical processes, and that the bifurcation of nature was a disaster for the European mind, then we're not disagreeing on much.
* [21 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201121042630/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1330003156701507585): I'm all for exploding dualism or "the bifurcation of nature" as Whitehead called it. But because of the irreducible nature of conscious experience that monism should lead to either some kind of panpsychism or idealism.

The excess of reason and violation of parsimony is more easily attributed to materialists since they reduce the only thing they can't doubt (their own consciousness) to an intellectual construct (matter)
* [21 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201121040442/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1329997887267364864): https://youtu.be/46kgmgI9fPs

That everything right down to sub-atomic particles possess some form of conscious experience however dim. "Matter" is a mental construct.

I certainly think clones would possess the same kind of consciousness as us. I think materialism is false primarily because it can't account for the hard problem of consciousness - we experience qualia that are not wholly reducible to the physical.

I don't know why you think not being a materialist necessarily entails some kind of hard metaphysical dualism and saying materialism doesn't make sense has nothing to do with arguing for arguing for some kind of spiritual world.

I said America was effectively an ethnostate. Now since we can (I assume) agree the naturalisation acts limited to white people did at least exclude Asians, clearly it was an ethnostate of some kind.

Europe had markets for a long time before capitalism developed and capital was sent into perpetual growth. If your country is reliant on having people with surplus capital investing it to generate growth it's capitalist.

In that sense China is capitalist, even if it's not ideological capitalists who control the capital.

Neo-liberalism is so antifragile that any sacrifice akin to 1916 today would just strengthen the systems hand over dissenters.

It won't be mainstreamed because it discredits the system instead of reinforcing it. That doesn't mean they'll be able to get rid of it when half the country believes they witnessed a coup and Trump is declaring exactly that.

There may never be an election accepted by both sides in the US again. Half the country will believe they were robbed and witnessed a deep state coup before their eyes. Do you think that will help legitimise the system?

This is just evidence that 'pro-white' is an empty platitude that offers nothing of value to the discourse.

You claim to be 3p but are part of a movement that calls radfems queens, and with the feminists you openly reject tradition. You're a fine example of what I was talking about.

But I believe there were also religions genuinely derived from the mysticism of founders, gnosticism probably being a good example itself, also Taoism, Buddhism. I would disagree on conflating mysticism with transient religious experiences.

Mystical paths were traditionally held for a select elite (in Gnosticism - pneumatics, in Hinduism - Brahmins) so likely it correlated positively with intelligence

Having an emotional/ecstatic religious experience isn't what people generally mean by mysticism and I would bet those studies mean the former.

Also you have nothing to base what he would look like or do, since you have no foundation for ethical perfection without a foundation in ultimate reality. So you're back to square one anyway

I consider the Vedanta (the philosophical schools of Hinduism) and Buddhism, Taoism and even classical theism as expounded by someone like DB Hart or Pseudo-Dionysius to be describing the same truth.

It isn't inaccessible though since mystics usually offer a path to seekers to experience it for themselves, and they do so and report the same experience. I would refer to WT Stace or Ken Wilber for a better defense

I never see any of you defend your presupposed materialism other than to assert it is self evident.

You can't just repeat the Zeitgeist understanding of the world like it's self evident when it's a totally fringe opinion.

Religions have complex metaphysics that have nothing to do with racial moralization and which converge in significant ways. Mystical experience is universal and makes specific truth claims not race related.

If someone is going to say "all religion is bullshit invented to moralize/demoralize races" they could at least have a very basic understanding of the religions first

* [ 4 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201007003820/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1312895552598626304): No, I don't believe so.

No one will die for a made up God. If you want people to love their race, get them to love their race. No need to deconstruct all religion and invent a new one to do so.
* [ 4 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201005164925/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1312891284454027267): Sure, but not for lies.

In fact all of the claims you made about other religions were flat wrong. Also people aren't going to be moralised by something they know is a myth.
* [ 4 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201005072816/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1312883849815351298): Sure, but the claims made by the people I mentioned aren't related to group survival but are specific claims about the nature of ultimate reality. At a certain point reducing everything to racial pragmatism fails.
* [ 4 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201005233124/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1312883336902324225): Where disagreement actually lies is you are presuming that religion is a practical tool groups use to attain power. You haven't justified this at all and made many claims that show you're clueless on the topic (Buddhism was racial, Hinduism rejects hierarchy and is proselytising)
* [ 4 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201005133650/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1312882937554178054): All of your criticisms are basically specific to Christianity and you're just extending them to every other non-racial religion without justification. And it doesn't matter what you desire, you're treating religion like a commodity you go shopping for to meet your needs.
* [ 4 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201006150605/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1312874214857342986): They're not primarily moral claims in the people I mentioned. And sure there's 'regionality' but you'd have to show me something to say that race was the driving factor in any of them rather than just adding that regionality to non-racial teachings
* [ 4 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201005214134/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1312877789624836096): tbh some of the claims being made in this thread are just bizarre. Like callling Hinduism either liberal or proselytising makes no sense.

There isn't much difference between the teaching of Eckhart and Buddha, Lao Tzu or Sankara. They make remarkably bold and specific claims but differ little in the view they expound. What is the basis for this?
* [ 4 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201005085540/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1312868366181445634): You said all religions functioned as racial moralization "except Christianity". In any event, what do you think motivated Buddha or the authors of the Upanishads? They were plotting to dissolve strong races?
* [ 4 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201005085540/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1312868366181445634): This doesn't apply to any major religion really. Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Sikhism, Zoroastrianism aren't racial moralization, they clearly make real claims about the world and have advanced philosophy and theology which is divorced from racial moralization.

The left has been stripped of its economically illiberal aspects and is now merely a battering ram for social liberalism with a Marxist aesthetic.

International capitalists and bourgeois anarchists are united in a desire to homogenise the world into one marketplace, and are fighting a zero-sum war against anything that resists their neo-colonial project.

The sharp dualism you mention, the demystification of the world and the extreme personalism of modern protestantism is Christianity stripped of its European, neo-Platonic aspect
* [30 September 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201001014150/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1311447405473259520): Yes. Metaphysical idealism is the truth and would be the teaching of every religion if not for varying layers of exoteric stuff. I think Vedanta is the clearest philosophical expression of the truth but the neo-platonism of someone like Plotinus or Proclus was remarkably similar
* [30 September 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201001014150/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1311447405473259520): How about Gregory of Nyssa, Maximus the Confessor, any of the early church fathers. Neo-Platonism is basically western vedanta and not the kind of strict dualism people attribute to plato

Christianity until the middle ages was much more mystical and you had philosophers like Eriugena whose beliefs weren't much different from Eastern vedanta

I was told by son of appollo that materialism is self evident but obviously that doesn't mean its a uniform belief to you guys. I personally have no interest in attacking your project, but I'm happy to lay out my disagreements if challenged.

Most Appollonians I have spoken to consider materialism to be a self-evident starting point

I believe there are objective, metaphysical truths about the world and that making a contingent being the supreme being would necessarily exclude metaphysics as a source of truth because polytheism can't be justified philosophically

People who consider truth something to be used in their service rather than something there to be discovered

It seems to me that the project of encouraging people to worship a God you know does not exist would be subjugating truth to something you consider more important.

Trump victory.

Also I don't really feel threatened by Nazbols having horrible twitter takes, but then I enjoy debate and ideological discussions, whereas someone like Strucker apparently sees it more his role to maintain dialogue within a strict WN framing he believes is effective

But I believe we can know the existence of consciousness with certainty, and that equating it with material processes is incoherent.

However, any study of the brain is done in consciousness, which always precedes any interaction with the world. The immaterial always precedes the material.

Again consider Chalmers' analogy of the colour blind neuroscientist, there's always a subjective, qualitative aspect to experience that is not identical to objective physical states.

A car is still some arrangement of the physical world, as is a brain.

If you are tying it to Marxian offshoots of communism then "dialectical materialism" remains a method of historical analysis, and not a definition of communism.

You can talk all you want about the importance of building parallel institutions, but if your reaction to a nationalist political movement forming is to express concern about it costing Trump votes, you are working to defend a system that is destroying white people

This year both have rapidly accelerated. I doubt they'll meet again.

That's far more respectable than the public shaming and wild accusations others have engaged in and you are clearly open to debate your positions in good faith

This is surely reason to keep conservatism as the focus of attack and continue to articulate the third position given that there is such an appetite

If this seizure of freedom is as urgent as you say it is it would surely make more sense to focus all your energy on that than try and purify other nationalist circles. I'm happy to part ways

I've been accused of being a communist duginist Islamist since February by accounts that are openly obsessed with discrediting me personally. Now since making an ideological critique of of an element of white nationalism the same accounts are playing victim.

You responded with a "fellow white allies" quote suggesting that the people disagreeing with you aren't real nationalists. It's very toxic.

With 71 percent opposed to the border wall and 78 percent opposed to "family separation". https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/05/24/jews-still-despise-trump/

There are many other ways of showing the claim is true, look at their attitudes to Israel, a racial state even supported by leftist Js. Read Kevin MacDonald

The claim is that their underlying motivation is what benefits their racial group, not that they all agree on what that is.

The point is regardless of whether they want to leave the EU or not, in both cases a large factor motivating their decision is what they think benefits J*ws

* [25 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200504001333/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1254124008997560321): Why are you putting  "too stupid to understand me" in quotes like it's something I ever said? It's kind of sad you have to keep misrepresenting me like this while decrying infighting. Hopefully people will read the last thread and see your accusations are unfounded.
* [25 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200504051856/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1254112558115696646): The whole premise of your poll was I was supposedly stoking attacks on you. You made multiple false allegations and didn't provide evidence. I have a solution - please leave me alone and we can both do our own thing. Stop holding me responsible for the actions of others.
* [25 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200503222305/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1254111310746472455): That is irrelevant to the point though I can see why you want to change course. You have accused me of subtweeting you, calling you a liberal in DMs, retweeting attacks on you. All was false. Every time I ask for evidence you accuse me of dodging. This is just childish infighting
* [25 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200504045421/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1254107506336464899): You say that. I think people that read back on this thread will have a different opinion.

This is so obviously a ridiculous standard
* [25 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200503214954/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1254100318985555969): No. I have not publicly called out infighting. I suppose I am therefore responsible for everyone that has been infighting with you. As is every other figure on pro white twitter that doesn't tweet enough discouragement of infighting. Are you going to make polls about them now?
* [25 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200503200616/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1254098453514391553): Why am I specifically coming under scrutiny for how many times I have publicly discouraged infighting? Are people annoying you with disagreements the fault of Greg Johnson or Mike Enoch or anyone else in the movement for not tweeting more to discourage infighting?
* [25 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200504070534/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1254098049535795201): You have made many allegations against me which I believe are false and I have defended myself and asked for evidence. I consider any pro white natsoc my ally. Did you tell people not to infight after sharing a tweet accusing me of being pro Islam? No, and I didn't expect you to.
* [25 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200503212343/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1254093830657200129): And you obviously are a racialist first and foremost so the comment about people adopting nationalism to preserve liberalism obviously doesn't apply to you either
* [25 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200504013957/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1254093474233823238): "much of ethno-nationalism". Since you're a natsoc that obviously wasn't directed at you.
* [25 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200503181203/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1254093113125154816): Agreed. I'm just clarifying myself to RC, it's a shame if he thinks I'm focused on attacking him because that's the last thing in the world I'm interested in.
* [25 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200504010710/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1254091661388460032): Again, I'd like to see evidence of that. I don't believe I called you any of those things in recent DMs. I can tell you once again that I don't follow your takes and I dont subtweet you. This is as tenuous as me accusing you of infighting for attacking former leftists
* [25 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200504035344/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1254088405786427392): "He's accused me of being Liberal, neo-Liberal, and Libertarian, etc."  Can you provide any evidence of this? I have never even followed your page and don't know your worldview.
* [25 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200504035344/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1254088405786427392): I am hardly personally responsible for people annoying you in replies because I don't discourage infighting often enough.  And your claim I subtweeted and retweeted attacks on you is false. Perhaps you should make that clear if you don't want to encourage infighting.
* [25 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200504013510/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1254084568124215299): It was an article by that SP account, perhaps I'm mistaken. If so then I apologise. Anyway the point is I have never attacked you, nor do I intend to. I'm sure I have more followers that like your stuff than attack you so I don't see why I should be held responsible.
* [25 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200504061834/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1254081655519789057): The only recent example of that was I retweeted someone who countered someone after falsely accused me of advocating communism. The first time I heard of you was when you retweeted stuff about me promoting Islam, and you recently shared an article accusing me of being a Duginist.
* [25 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200504054109/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1254082007648346118): I dont know why you think I don't want peace. I have never attacked you. I have almost 8000 followers on this plarform, it's hardly fair to hold me responsible if some of them are attacking you.
* [25 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200504061834/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1254081655519789057): I subtweeted you once to correct you on a historical point regarding former leftists in national socialism. I haven't retweeted someone attacking you.
* [25 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200504033113/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1254027101507850240): If its a poll to find out who the dissident right thinks is the biggest threat to whites it is worth including them because they are most likely to come first place.

* [25 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200503205712/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1253883242241052679): I'm not saying liberal environmentalists can be turned, but their constant fear of eco fascism shows they know that environmentalism is ripe ground for illiberal racialists

The constant attempt to drag up old tweets and obviously misrepresent what they are advocating (criticising liberalism means you're a communist) makes it seem more sinister than a misunderstanding
* [25 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200504070652/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1253880261227528192): Ah yes the "proof" I'm a communist is I criticise liberalism from an NS standpoint and point out that race realism is so evident even the founder of communism accepted it. Clearly a communist

* [25 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200504063709/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1253871441830981638): As I said, I have never attacked Strucker and I don't know what his beef is. I seem to be on his mind a lot though. I agree with your sentiment, hence why i rarely respond to these constant false accusations
* [25 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200503171623/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1253871179217145857): That's not Strikers account. Striker is a genuine third positionist that advocates for the same things that Strucker calls me a communist for advocating.
* [25 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200503171342/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1253869675743715330): You can ask Mr. Strucker. I have never attacked him but have been on the receiving end of numerous false accusations and attacks from him. Months after he attacked me for supposedly being pro-Islam he is still spreading lies about me on other peoples pages (I am a natcom??)
* [25 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200504001121/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1253866376718147586): Are you going to answer?

* [25 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200503144000/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1253863822970040322): The strongest argument against it is "what if there's another Chernobyl" but we already have thousands of nuke plants so it's kind of a bit late to discuss that moral conundrum at this stage.

* [24 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502203914/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1253748606445785090): Yeah he's definitely at least in part putting it on. But beyond his posh accent and thoughtful sounding videos it's the same old dogshit of classical liberalism, smugly chuckling at both the stupid sjw's who rule him and the people trying to do something about it.
* [24 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200430030431/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1253746846033416193): I think he has that Sargon effect of people thinking he's far more intelligent than he is because of his accent

The people you named are racial identitarians and third positionists. That's very different to Dugins worldview. And the idea of Eurasianism long predates Dugin and was often supported by white identitarians

I also reject his relativism of cultural achievements. So no, he's not on our side, however the constant accusations of Duginism are just right wing russiagate imo and his influence is overblown

If not for Stalins brutal industrialisation they would have lost the war. Collective defence by peasants with no industtrial base won't do much against the force of the Wehrmacht

It was covert class warfare.

If I say the modern state is too wreak I only mean in the areas it should be powerful.

I'm saying the spurious connection of Duginism to anti Americanism in the dissident right is stifling conversation and pushing pro whites back to the dead end of Judeo-liberalism

It makes a conversation about moving away from Anglo-Judaic liberalism very difficult.
* [ 9 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200409134032/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1248243614527840256): Isn't the simplest explanation that white nationalists generally end up seeing the US as the force most destructive to nationalism and the interests of whites?

But the views of people like Faye and Thiriart are far closer to what these people believe though. I honestly don't see any evidence of Dugins thought penetrating the right in a significant way

Most of these people are third positionists and race realists. Opposing US hegemony as an enemy of white preservation has been a popular idea in the European right since the 50s. You could cite Yockey, Thiriart, Faye etc.

The East has produced many philosophers on a par with the best European philosophy - Nagarjuna, Shankara, Ramanuja etc.   By writing them off Duchesne shows his ignorance. https://twitter.com/DuchesneRicardo/status/1246831002175123462

I read Faye and De Benoist before I had heard of an alt right. I thought you would present an argument around the ideas but instead just weird personal stuff and pretending you know how I think

All were virulently opposed to the United States. Thiriart was writing just second the second world war. Its not an American idea in origin, US/NATO promotes petty nationalism

There is an anti establishment movement that uses the rhetoric of nationalism and is opposed to immigration, along with 5g, vaccines, chemtrails, environmentalism.

The NSDAP used aggressive Keynesian policies to build up their economy, rebuild the army and encourage Germans to start having families so they could eventually be a force to challenge Anglo materialism and the Asiatic nihilism of bolshevism.

Again that is not a natural hierarchy. In fact, that is quite an egalitarian view! If anyone can acquire imperium in an evolian sense through success in commerce that is not an organic hierarchy at all

In a free market Instagram models are millionaires and working class Aristotles and Beethovens need to spend the bulk of their time labouring.

Some hierarchies aren't natural. The free market rewards the bourgeois values and materialism that evola and spengler despised.

These tweets all come from around the same time period and it was specifically to have this discussion.

I think it is on the whole nihilistic, unsophisticated and dysgenic. I have questioned if Islam would have been better for us as a means to challenge the liberal current of thought which prevents a genuine racialist understanding of things.

It is my observation that many people that call themselves racialists and dissidents are simply racist conservatives.

Of course, you could just ask me my thoughts on Islam, and I would tell you I think it's a nihilistic desert religion

But those people have also chose capitalism as their vehicle ever since the trotskyites fled Stalin. Soros, Paul Singer, Michael Bloomberg, these are the subverters and their tool is international finance

He certainly didn't inspire the subversion of the west. Most things people attribute to him are just the social effects of modern capitalism

Liberalism has become a totalising ontology rather than a political theory.
* [ 4 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200304041307/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1235044354105970688): Im sure there are other alternatives, but those are the three that immediately come to mind as at least being coherent. I suppose there all manner of illiberal leftist totalising worldviews too, communism being the most obvious (though today that is mostly just liberalism anyway)

And of course, most ideology is a reflection of some necessity of the economic direction. Hence the need to find an ideological underpinning outside the limits of liberalism:  Religious social teaching Absolutism Racialism

Perhaps a strongman can freeze culture and hold off the contradictions, but eventually the capitalists require commodification and the the cultural logic of capitalism dominates the cultural realm
* [ 4 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200304033515/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1235040656659107841): I would argue peoples consciousness reflects that necessity. Rather than the system being one that expresses racial egalitarianism because people that believe in it usurped power
* [ 4 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200304031525/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1235039506711162886): I think AA would agree with you there perhaps. I would take the view more that the elite are the way they are because that kind of elite is necessary to the system currently. The social expression of neo-liberalism is human rights and racial egalitarianism
* [ 4 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200304031525/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1235039506711162886): The point is you can't freeze capitalism in time. Where our sides disagree is we see the same enemy, but you see them as having usurped a good system and we see the system as having contained some weakness, contradiction or necessary progression that produced that enemy
* [ 4 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200304031208/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1235036529170542593): With that said, I don't know how you marry a commitment to Austrian economics and 18th century liberalism with an acceptance of all of this.

Ideologies like liberalism and the celebration of the entrepreneur are useful for a while but eventually technique requires the move to a Chinese system to correct itself

It is by nature a fluid ecology that requires the constant transcendence of its natural limitations through destruction or integration. All the "cultural marxism" we see is just an expression of this. The move to state capitalism..

The final frontiers of commodification are experience. Product has been maximally commodified, time has not. Thus there is a growth in the commodification of experiences...
* [ 4 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200304030246/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1235035123579572224): This explains why you had to misrepresent the scale of share ownership by the public - this attempt to represent hyper techno-capitalism as a movement to a soviet system rather than a natural evolution of techno capital operating strictly within the limits of its internal logic
* [ 4 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200304030246/https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1235035123579572224): Was a pretty good video until you suggested that this is some kind of aberration of capitalism - a revolution of socialism. What you are describing is more a natural evolution of capitalism and has been predicted by many critics of capitalism such as Daniel Bell and Ellul.

Apparently even talking about Islam as an objective phenomenon is not allowed though according to the guardians of reactionary thought.

But there are any amount of ways to demonstrate his weaknesses. And perhaps he should remember I respect his desire to not use his real identity while he publicly accuses me of being an infiltrator and insulting me.

He was the first one to use a personal insult, the first to accuse me of being an infiltrator, having bad motives, lacking intelligence. All this before I ever said a word back against him.

He said you can ground morality without recourse to an unprovable axiom. I asked him to. He used species survival as an example. So I am asking him to prove it's a good thing without recourse to an unprovable assertion.

If you can't empirically prove species survival is a good thing how do you prove it? By arguing that without it we couldn't conceive of goodness? This is going in circles

In your second statement you agree there is no objective good?

Because the existence of morality is a good thing? You've just pushed it back to another unprovable, which you will presumably prove with something else unprovable.

I am seeing the same people that were signalling about homos a few years ago signalling about trans rights now. I am actually shocked to see how many normies now celebrate things like their children playng with toys of the opposite sex. It's subtle but there is change

As for welfare, you could just as easily have a eugenic welfare state as a dysgenic one.

I believe technique is self sustaining and determines social conditions to a large degree and you think the reverse. I find libertarians too usually give no thought to the effects of technique

That's the point. You see a good system on paper unnaturally corrupted, I see a reductio ad absurdum

The system does not fear blacks because the only time they organise (BLM, MLK) is when elites manipulate them into it.

Absolutely laughable, nothing to do with opening up our country to the most extreme effect of neo-liberalism and Zio-American cultural influence https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1148026345114521600

Just not much of substance here yet.

The problems identified in the video are those of hyper-individualism which is a logical result of liberalism. Communist countries tended to be far more conservative socially.

Why blame communism when it's far more parsimonious to point the finger at the plutocrats?
