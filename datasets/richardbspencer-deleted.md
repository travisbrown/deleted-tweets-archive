Today I'm proud of Joe Biden. He made a tough call‚Äîbut clearly the right one. He faced failure in the face, acted decisively, and articulated principles for moving forward. He did what Trump couldn't.

Many of the vague promises Trump talked about in 2016‚Äìand which he was too unserious to enact‚Äîwill be fulfilled by Democrats. https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1381992997328461826

But I'm think there's a chance this will all blow up in Trump's face. And the genuine scandal will get lost in mess.      Again, going out on a limb here. Just my gut feeling.

A computer repairman took them off Biden's laptop (likely illegally), when it was in for repair. He then contacted Rudy! It's nuts. https://soundcloud.com/rptrbnd/mac-shop-10-14-cm

And stories like his‚Äîincluding his fall from grace‚Äîhave reoccured over and over since Babylon. Child of privilege gets cushy job in exchange for influence + too much money and debauchery = scandale du jour.

I'm skeptical of the  #HunterBidenEmails . No, I don't think Biden is an angel. To the contrary, the basic accusation that he was given a  lucrative sinecure in Ukraine in a tacit exchange for influence with the America VP is almost certainly true.

I don't use. "Alt-Right" has its problems, but they are not nearly as bad as openly labeling yourself as "dissident." Until a better term comes along, I'll still use AR.

But the fact is, those anonymous "Nazbols" are in no position to actually deliver handouts either. They're LARPing harder than I ever have.

(Though it is true that talking about "socialism" does force more nuanced people in the media to give you a second thought.)

But it's worth talking about these issues, regardless.

The deaths of despair, bankruptcies through medical bills, and more are all expressions of this‚Äîor, more precisely, they're symptoms of deeper problems.

To call the BLM people "Bolsheviks," as conservatives do, is an insult to Bolsheviks, who were ruthless power seekers. BLM are feral pets.

You're not revolutionaries; you're pets of the White system, which funds and pampers you. If you don't want to be thought of slaves, then don't act like slaves.
