Shots are fired close behind you as you flee a violent man/men chasing you, and an assailant throws something at you, closes and grabs for your weapon as shots ring out.

Multiple big ones if you can.  A real game changer for home security.  Makes it very difficult for bad guys to sneak in or even to do a home invasion.  Helps buy you time to get your firearm into action.

The German people were presented with a false choice between communists and national socialists.

I called for him to call the National Guard into federal service, as part of the militia, to suppress a nationwide Marxist insurrection/rebellion. I said nothing about using the Army.  Big difference.  @StewartRhodesOK

John Frost, please try this:   Wear a Patriot Prayer shirt and hat, or a Trump shirt and hat, and walk around Portland after dark in the same area where the man was shot.

Marie, go watch the actual footage and read my commentary on it. And especially note the photos of the gun in the hand of the Antifa "medic" who got his arm shot nearly off.

That's just not bright.  ¬•es, if you are in a situation with an active shooter killing people all around you, charge him and do what you have to do.  But not if he is fleeing the scene.

He cannot let you take his weapon.  When he knows you have armed Antifa/BLM terrorist buddies nearby, he will be even more motivated to do what he has to do to retain his weapon.

The man was obviously in fear for his life, and was not in a rage.  He remained as calm as you can be under those circumstances.

He only fired at those attacking him & stopped shooting as soon as they stopped, with one backing away, hands in the air, & rifleman did not shoot him.  Then he continued to flee.

He's running away, as they chase, yelling "get his ass!"  2. He doesn't fire until he trips and they attack.   3.  Disparity of force.  Multiple opponents.  If he hadn't fired, they would have shot him with his own gun or beat him to death.

But the charges, except for two, were for possession of a weapon in or near a protest, not for rioting or vandalism.   Regardless, the statute is unconstitutional because it seeks to prohibit the bearing of arms while peaceably assembling.  That impacts both 1st & 2nd

Easy to shoot well, easy to use/best controls.  Accurate.  Decent stock trigger. Available ammo.  Standard American platform they need to learn.  Then they can add a .300 Blackout upper or AR10.

AR ergonomics, lighter than the FAL, better trigger, more accurate, but still firing 7.62x51, which has better penetration of cover, especially at range, & busts brush better than 5.56.    2. AK in 7.62x39.  Reliable as the sunrise.    @StewartRhodesOK

Slow and heavy beats light and fast in brush every time.  One reason I prefer 7.62x39 or .300 Blackout to 5.56x45 in forests/brush. Light bullets deflect off of brush.

Not a good look and an absolute disaster for morale, especially among SEALS and other special warfare warriors.    The brass will desert you and throw you under the bus for politics.

If Trump pardoned him, he MUST be evil & deserving of ‚Äúalternate punishment‚Äù by any means necessary.  But if Gallagher came out as anti-Trump, then he‚Äôd be a hero to them.

The Commander-in-Chief pardons a SEAL for a lesser offense he was found guilty of (posing for a photo with a dead terrorist) and the brass get back at the President by punishing the sailor by attempting to strip him of his SEAL status.

But those cartels would STILL engage in sexual slavery/forced prostitution, especially of children, supplying pedophiles with victims.  The cartels need killing.

The cartels are taking over U.S. towns and counties, just like they do in Mexico.    This requires military defense.

Period.  That would be a gift to the people of Mexico as well as the U.S., just like crushing ISIS benefited eveyone, including the people of Iraq and Syria.  The cartels are equally evil and oppressive.

The Mexican government is either corrupt and in the cartels‚Äô pocket, or they are too weak to stop them. Either way, the cartels now command territory in Mexico and are trying to do the same in the U.S.    It‚Äôs time to act.

You know, like ‚Äúpunch a Nazi.‚Äù    I‚Äôll do a post on armed assault if it makes you feel better.  But for now, why don‚Äôt we discuss how dangerous it is to encourage young idiots to run around punching people.

I didn‚Äôt say Antifa knocked him out.üôÑ I said unarmed assault can be deadly and to keep that in mind when considering Antifa‚Äôs clearly states intent to ‚Äúpunch a Nazi‚Äù which means attack anyone seen as being on the right.

It happens more than than people realize.   And people need to understand that any assault can turn deadly, whether from the punch itself or from secondary impact.  @StewartRhodesOK

Which is why I posted this.  As you said, disparity of force is real, whether it is a strong teen attacking a senior citizen or a group attacking a lone victim. Empty hands can still kill. @StewartRhodesOK

Their demanding a dollar was just a pretext to engage him and part of their ‚Äúinterview‚Äù to see if he was safe to attack, in their view.

The teens demanded a dollar from the victim and when he refused, one of them sucker punched him. Now he‚Äôs dead.    Don‚Äôt let hostile people get close enough to strike.

Something to keep in mind regarding Antifa‚Äôs love affair with assaulting people to silence their speech.

He can call the National Guard (as part of the militia) into national service for the three reasons listed in Article 1, Section 8:   ‚Äúto execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions;‚Äù  And Congress provided for that in statutes long ago.

Unless you are defending yourself or another from physical attack, you are not legally justified in using force.  Other people‚Äôs opinions or speech don‚Äôt constitute assault that you can physically defend against.  Note how she tries to justify it.

There are times when a knife is useful.

That‚Äôs why the left wants it so bad.  Republicans support it too out of ignorance (pressure to ‚Äúdo something‚Äù) or because many of them are really anti-gun (like Peter King of NY).

Centralized oligarchy, part of a budding world oligarchy in actual practice.  In design? A constitutional republic, made up of sovereign states with a limited federal government. But that design is barely recognizable anymore. Can we restore it?  @StewartRhodesOK

Which is why I worked for Congressman Paul in his D.C. office. The true constitutional answer is to call forth a well regulated militia made up of We the people.

There was already a total ban on such rifles in France.  Didn't stop them.  Nor would a total ban stop it here.  Cartels will smuggle them in along with drug. @StewartRhodesOK

Off duty and undercover cops have also been killed by uniformed officers too.  In that case, a retention holster would have helped.

There have been several instances of CCW carriers assisting police.  But even if other police don't, do you let that stop you from doing what's right?

But they are now afraid of losing their jobs, because they know their mayor/‚ÄúPolice Commissioner‚Äù is a far left buddy to Antifa.  It‚Äôs fear of being fired. Not a fear of Antifa.

Like I said before, in Portland Antifa owns whatever street they want - till a bunch of strong patriots show up.  Then, not so much.

It‚Äôs not an isolated incident, as in outside the bounds of what they advocate.  It‚Äôs directly in line.

We won‚Äôt be making arrests, determining guilt or innocence, or meeting out punishment.  Just preventing assault.  Antifa, on the other hand, IS vigilanteism - passing judgment on who is ‚Äúguilty‚Äù of ‚Äúfascism‚Äù and meeting out punishment.

People have been stomped and beaten to death like that.  So that disparity of force and risk of death also can justify use of lethal force in self-defense.
