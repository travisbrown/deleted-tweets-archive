Then that’s good. And you should be grateful to her as a friend.   but if she is really your good friend, she’s gonna want you to keep custody and coparenting. She may have been a friend to you over that, but she’s not helping you now. She’s not. That Amy troll...

You can marry Libby for all I care. You still have to tell her to leave the mother of your child alone. If you are unwilling to do that, then yes you’re gonna lose custody.

You can love your gf, if you want, but tell her to get this woman’s name out of her mouth

She’s fawned on men serially and been flatly rejected each time for a reason, then refused to take no for an answer. Her trolling an exhausted new mother is absolutely *disgusting*. She will never know how newborn feels.

Props to JF for revealing the extent of it. I don't have to be a fan of his or vice versa to say that was the right thing to do.

I say again though you may be mad at me, if the judge has evidence Libby trolled the mom of your child on your watch, I really doubt you win
* [11 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210411041301/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1381097813409472513) ([live](https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1381097361183752192)): you are not being there though if you allow your girlfriend and her friends to troll the mother of your child, as happened today, and the judge will look at that.   As the Dad, you are the protector of this family 1/2
* [11 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210411040538/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1381095901922521089): and if you think I'm lying contact any lawyer you know in family law because I'm right and they will tell you the same.

Is everything perfect of course not. But I never let anybody usurp his rights and place as father and vice-versa. Never happened. No romantic partner was permitted to insult the other parent. Not a chance in hell.

If a judge believes that you and Spar cannot respectfully coparent, the judge will grant one of you full custody and give the other one, at best, occaisonal visitation, and not even that if the non-custodial parent is rude to the custodial one. I have a 50-50 CP rel'p

My best advice to you, man. I wish you all three the best.)

The judge will pick one. And that's very sad because whoever "wins" you guys' family loses.
* [11 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210411035450/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1381093322496827392): Nobody can litigate the heart though of course I wish you two were together. Family court always, no exceptions, puts the child's welfare first. Co-parenting demands respect and cooperation. If you guys cannot, you cannot, but that is tragedy because one of you will lose custody.
* [11 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210411035329/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1381092825882886144): don't let her boss you from the bottom, and she, Libby, put that out to threaten you the night she thought you would return to your family. I wish you well man, I really do. Loving deference to the mom raising your son is step one; she's getting 3.5 hours of sleep per night RN.
* [11 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210411035137/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1381092418855055360): Don't take her BS (Lib's). If you let her go at the mother of your child, any judge in America will give the mom full custody. If you want to be the stronger partner, be it. Tell her comms with or references to your co-parent are totally out of bounds. That's your family not hers
* [11 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210411034759/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1381091548994150401): dude she will, if you get Libby off her back and reach out to her with compassion and honor. Please try it. I have no agenda here at all other than as a divorced mom who has been where you are now. You can love someone else and still say 'mom of my kid is off-limits". Try it.

The judge will look to the child. She is your son's mother Aub. Be smart, man. Off to bed, wish your fam luck.

You must work with each other in honor to maintain custody with each parent honoring the primacy of the other over outsiders. I don't know if that makes sense but it should.
* [11 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210411034244/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1381090203335540736): I have a successful and sustained co-parenting relationship. Rule Number One is that neither parent allows any outsider to attack the other parent.   Basic logic should tell you that if you persist nothing but hostile to each other one of you will lose big in family court 1/2

I'm trying to help you here. Unless you are claiming some kind of assault or rape you two agreed to parent together that night. You don't have to be in love.

You do not "deserve happiness" as you put it. You are a sadist who deserves prison.

Then she will send up memes and try to claim she was always setting you up. She's ugly and she's besotted with Fionda and yet the mother of your child still loves you.  Be smart, kid. Ends.

And I will tell you this, block me if you must. You are facing very serious DOJ consequences as you have already rightly said yourself. This is the mother of your child, who loves you, man. Who will stick with you. Don't be dumb. EOF.

The night you were feeling very bad and thought about going back to your family, "Libby" threatened you.

Control your (temporary) woman, who sent a thousand emails to Joe Fionda like a month ago, and give the correct deference and precedence to the mother of your child.

I am a mom, you are a dad. Libby Shaw is abusing the mother of your child. Get a grip on your end.

So freaking what. Out of deference to her status as the mother of your child that no gross troll like Libby Shaw can EVER take away, you should at a minimum tell Shaw to never mention her again
* [11 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210411031844/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1381084026711257088): Right. And I did that how exactly, Aubrey.  The mother of your child has post-partum depression. you are dating a rancid troll who said "I blocked her" in conjunction with another account your girlfriend sent to troll her. How about supporting her. She is hurting.

She can carry on mooching over a dude who is examining his closet really hard RN, and has no interest in her. We should drop the topic.

I have no interest in admitting women who defend the abusers of other women to my acquaintance. Very very best of luck in ever getting TinyD1ck to engage in direct contact. My friends - formerly her friends - were seriously harmed by "EG".

My crew is well aware that Doug/Micro and JCrew are besties and that JCrew connect to CWA as well. Doug---CWA = plausible but zero evidence in the public domain.

TinyD1ck went at a literally dying "friend" of hers; she said nothing.

To me it was her defense of Eric Garbage, who nearly caused my friend Eve to commit serious self-harm, that evaporated both sympathy and respect for her.
* [11 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210411031844/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1381084026711257088) ([live](https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1381040140374704128)): yes ma'am. Always remember, you are not crazy, you are seeking a normal and stable situation and I don't know if you can get it, but what you are trying to do is not weird, and you are in the right.

Garbage proposed marriage to her then ghosted her.  What he did was infamous. He is contemptible. The women who excuse him, including Jazzie, are also contemptible.  And that's where I will leave it. Better things to think about.
* [10 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210410213708/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1380998242637348864) ([live](https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1380997557787189248)): Loo did tell me long ago and I didn't pay enough attention to any of it precisely because I liked Eric and because he's so unattractive vs Loo, Eve, etc, I didn't take the idea seriously. Only when Jar got angry enough to speak plainly was the extent of it all revealed to me.

It's not dependent on personality, it's dependent on truth.

I didn't react and don't carry grudges. Emotional trauma does things to people. But while blocked by her I did NOT start saying "maybe she made it up". 1/2

* [10 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210411013703/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1381058565838880774) ([live](https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1380994742520066050)): I don't have *malice* in my heart for J, but the pity I felt for her, which included an element of protectiveness over how she was publicly flinging herself at T who was brutally ignoring it, has evaporated now because she defended Garbage who IMO abused six of my friends.
* [10 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210410220745/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1381005868053958661) ([live](https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1380994294912331785)): Ultimately she, rather like Colby, who I believe is in her sixties, probably has a crush on Garland and so she can't afford to believe the entirely uniform account of all his accusers. And J, regretfully, also started backing Garbage. So the same applies to her. (not the crush)
* [10 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210410213708/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1380998242637348864) ([live](https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1380993764597071881)): She had the gall to add "it's not Louise's business either". Yes, it is. When six women friends first hand and in public say a male friend emotionally abused them, and that male friend won't even deny the charge, it is of course my business as a decent person and a friend.

Yes, it is your business. If your friends say a man emotionally abused them, in public, that makes it your business. You chose to betray and gaslight your friends for a man who didn't deny it.

They gently told him he’s not alleging any criminal or civil bad acts under American law either, so the answer is no. Hence anti-FBI rage.

He probably checked after I told him you can’t libel a pseudonym and was told that is also correct. So reverted to this. 1/2

Insisting on an anonymous internet persona has consequences. One is that you cannot be libeled. Another is it’s no crime to make as many parody or plain copycat accounts of your persona as anyone feels like.

But they still preclude even a theoretical action over something that isn’t illegal, like making imitation accounts of an anonymous internet persona

But a private prosecutor won’t help either. Not crime

I don't know  @1weesel  and the troll gang targeted him for suicide, but it wasn't to do with his own trolling. Doug Stewart shared his penchant for Dugin, "PodestaEmails", Wikileaks, Weev, and Russia. The fact they made a fake account in his name is bad for them

Refusal to talk = malice. Last night you openly stated that you’ve spread malicious lies about me to others for years. The per se defamation is a very big problem given  @DataCollectAc  taking you seriously.

You are an anonymous account “Mensch has been quiet since I threatened to sue her” - never happened. But if you won’t talk and were lying about wanting to, and I find out your real name, I will sue you.

You’ve lied about me, you have committed per se defamation of me, you lied that I committed crimes and that I trolled a man to suicide and hacked your documents. Only because  @DataCollectAc  and  @WebCoderz  appear to respect you am I offering to talk now. 1/2

Holding grudges is stupid if we share the same goals on disinfo. If you are not willing to talk when offered, you weren’t being serious.

That never happened. Ever. You say you want to talk. I’ve offered to talk. 1/2

You said I instructed someone to “invade your slack” and steal your “private documents” which is BS. I’m giving you the benefit of the doubt here as people I respect appear to respect you. To the best of my recollection only one friend of mine ever infiltrated a Slack.

He was fully entitled to infiltrate a Slack with Teknow in it; I didn’t get any “private google docs” of yours. If I did I would know who you are right now. I don’t.   You can DM anytime you want. I will talk to any researcher.

I don’t know who you are.   You had very bad actors in that Slack, specifically @/TeknowMusic. If you didn’t know that you should have guarded it better. BTW, i only know that because he attacked me

I’m open to hearing that she is. Otherwise they are pretty self-explanatory.

So far, he hasn’t.
* [29 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210329161446/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1376568444884283393) ([live](https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1376564739921301504)): He had (I assume) a video of some girl who vaguely resembles me dancing with Steve Bannon. It went on for a week, and was planned in DMs as a career-ending attack on me since February.  He needs an intervention. For real.
* [29 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210329161446/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1376568444884283393) ([live](https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1376564191411249153)): I unfollowed, didn’t block him. I just said “you and I have a different mission on here”. He didn’t take it well. Started a mad attack that has lasted four years at this point, culminating in a month of insisting he had proof I danced with Steve Bannon on election night 2016.
* [29 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210329161446/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1376568444884283393) ([live](https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1376563663495163908)): To be fair to me, I did try to cut ties with Nethery after he started ranting at Sarah Kendzior which was unhelpful *even though* her associations aren’t good. He told me in DM he didn’t care about getting Trump out and only tagging bad actors was important, I said, we differ.
* [29 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210329161446/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1376568444884283393) ([live](https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1376562987075522565)): F—- knows. Because I and James Mackenzie used to promote him. I have to take some responsibility. He and I have a mutual friend. It was my fault for extending the respect I have for that person to Nethery. He’s not responsible for Nethery and I should have stayed far away.
* [29 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210329161446/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1376568444884283393) ([live](https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1376560513883246598)): Let’s see if he stops.

You can’t sue me - you can’t sue anybody, for anything, related to “ @Bitburner ”. I could call you the mass-murdering son of Godzilla and you still could not sue me. You cannot libel a pseudonym.

So you’ve just admitted to spreading a succession of lies about me to others, and you’ve admitted to trolling me for years based on your false assumption. And you worked with MAGA to do this, with Adam Gingrich. Amazing.

By the way, any “personal documents” he took from there he never gave me, and I wouldn’t have accepted any. I had to reply to the false accusation.

If you want to talk (and Tish Cohen, not any ally of mine, is posting those screenshots) by all means DM me and I’ll give you a number. I am *always* happy to talk politely with literally anyone, even (maybe especially) Russians.

A woman in her thirties has been arrested for assisting an offender; the assumption must be that is Couzens’ wife. Both parents arrested. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/10/scotland-yard-officer-arrested-suspicion-murder-sarah-everard/amp/

Today  @metpoliceuk  announced they discovered human remains in woodland in Kent. The suspect is arrested on suspicion of murder, kidnapping, indecent exposure. (Suggests access to his phone).

I have to work on “the enemy of my enemy is not necessarily my friend” as his scattergun approach hits good and bad folks indiscriminately, and he’s so annoying you start to sympathize with the bad folks... i catch that, but it’s tempting.

If so he lied to the FBI because the other SS very clearly refer to not being paid first. I object to being physically threatened. Hell yes I’m reporting it. Now i’m really done.

Unfortunately for him it’s preceded by a bunch of SS talking about being stiffed by the government.   Most likely he woke up with a hangover, realized what he’d done and reported them as pen tests.

I meant it. What tf is unclear to you. Nor was it a “pen test”. I have the entire episode recorded. It was done because he felt USG owed him money. Per him. I have the context, everything i need.

When I said that he was a peripheral part of the troll gang mentioned in the Mackey indictment and I meant it. But he left that group because they went full Nazi, or more accurately, stopped pretending not to be.

That’s your argument?
* [10 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210310160816/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1369681431140700163) ([live](https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1369670111716642822)): What do you mean? He’s mentioned Welna approximately 10,000 times since returning with his 26th account after all the others were banned.
* [10 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210310152348/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1369669588586266626): Again. I filed a report in 2017. Not “poking”. Haven’t otherwise commented on the man. Not on my radar. Now he is. Attempts to intimidate me never work and merely refocus my gaze after it had moved on. If the report was ignored, what does he have to worry about? If not, good.

Try and be more factual and less reflexively defensive of your allies.

You can just reply to me.

Any friend of Trump's is no friend of Vindman's. IMO, anyway. But I did not block her and don't intend to.

To do this, he's amplifying Garland, Woky and Nethery. She retweets, likes, replies, chats with him.

If she liked him because she was "a target for some bad folks" then you have a right to empathy when you are a target of bad folks and she buddies up to them. She is now blocking people who gave her sympathy, like  @AdogslifeTO . That's on her.

I will delete but unlike Tundra and Garland, I say things openly and not behind people's backs. I am reporting the Tundra guy to the Canadian police and Garland to US law enforcement tomorrow for harassment. I have NOTHING to do w it.

That’s why you and  @karolcummins  are both so dishonest. You were both there as Woody stalked all of us, mostly me but you both were on that list.

Chris Nethery harassed me offline, Jay. Do you care? You are saying “NOPE” with this

However I am of course only a female friend. Nethery gets to do whatever he likes to me with your approval. Including writing blogs on me.   Grim.

It’s sad AF that men will side with harassers against their female allies, men who would rightly demand a total ban on Jamali, etc, for example.   I cannot tell you how upsetting and ugly this tweet is to me.

They declined.   He went to Italy and asked them to vouch for Josef Mifsud.  They declined.    @SDNYNews  cannot stop Bill Barr trying to pressure them, too - doesn’t mean they agreed.

By the way, the fact Bill Barr went to  @SDNYNews  doesn’t mean they are in cahoots with him.  It can just as easily mean Bill Barr tried to pressure them NOT to arrest Rudy’s pal Parnas.  Bill Barr just toured the UK and Europe to pressure them to turn on  @FBI . https://twitter.com/dirkschwenk/status/1219296414112632832

He may wish to hire private security. A “transition period” could possibly keep the couple protected at public expense til Harry finds his own contractors. One possible example of what “transition period” may mean.

Meghan already left. Best guess: means a limited continuation of UK-taxpayer funded security until they find/buy a house of their own.  Canada seems not to want to pay this bill. Can’t ask UK working people to pay it.

They are indeed onerous. You can’t be forced into it by birth.  But few in the UK want them to leave AND keep the HRH / Prince and Princess.

If Harry decides to snap out of it, it's possible HM or his father could restore titles. Trust with MS is gone, IMO; once title goes, won't return

However, notification to  #FVEY  as presently constituted risks notification to Moscow am sure  @GCHQ  have said as much backchannel.

A gross terrorist mastermind is dead, the sky has not fallen and all the whiners look like idiots - at best.  It is a trap. This was a great kill. We will never politicize military action.

No World War III.  2. No major terrorist actions. 3. No big cyberstrikes.  Then, in retrospect, whining about the kill now will lose vital swing votes. That’s just political fact.

Iran does nothing much. A real bad dude is dead.   Then what?  Then those that whine and protest now are going to look awful.

An American can try to influence our elections, he is allowed to do that in law. Is it illegal for him knowingly to push a Russian botnet for that purpose, and if so, why is it illegal (for him not them)

That indictment was against IRA operatives, who for example evaded customs and FARA.   What if an American paid them to do it on his behalf? If a crime, why?
* [29 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200107191849/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1211329879104462850): Yes that is the premise. But Americans are allowed to try to influence American elections, so is there anything in law to stop them doing that in collaboration with the Internet Research Agency, technically a private Russian company? Is it sanctioned, for example? Can't recall.

Please note guys, the question is what crime would the American be committing, not the IRA - foreigners are not allowed to influence elections - it's about the American, in this question.

But does FARA not apply only to governments?   conspiracy to defraud is a pretty interesting one. Is the idea that a crime is committed by pushing knowingly false bots on Americans...?

However, that won't change  @SenateGOP  minds because, as they said, they are not impartial. Manage your expectations.

It claims the Blackberries will prove Mike Flynn was working with Russian intelligence agents since 2014 outside the United States.

Previously we only associated Flynn with  @GeorgePapa19  and  @simonamangiante . Now, Flynn’s lawyers essentially admit he was in contact with Mike Flynn...  since 2014.

On the surface, it looks like another random filing by  @GenFlynn ’s lawyers saying Mifsud’s newly impounded Blackberries “exculpate” Flynn and must be adduced for sentencing.

It would be good to see Mr. Rosenstein comment on his reasons for not charging Trump vs Bill Barr's; he has felt able to comment on his reasons for firing  @Comey  vs Trump's. Nonetheless, that's our guess as to his pinned tweet.
* [14 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191015020809/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1183891976246222849): 16./ But on the substance of Trump Russia, Bill Barr, buying time for his client  @AlfaBank , had taken away from  @RodRosenstein  the admissibility of the evidence on obstruction, namely the Trump campaign's specifically criminal interactions with  @Wikileaks .
* [14 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191015020809/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1183891976246222849): 15./ And he may be right. There are still questions around the firing of  @Comey . One of them, for Mr. Rosenstein, is "when you said [Trump's] reasons are not my reasons" do you not admit Trump obstructed as *his* motive for the firing was illegal?
* [14 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191015020809/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1183891976246222849): 14./ It would appear from his pinned tweet that  @RodRosenstein , who cannot discuss specifics, is saying that as a prosecutor he just did not have enough admissible evidence left, once Barr gutted out Trump/Wikileaks from Mueller's report, to prosecute Trump.
* [14 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191015020809/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1183891976246222849): 13./ When Bill Barr illegally classified and redacted material relating to  @RealDonaldTrump  and Wikileaks, he, knowingly and willfully, took those materials, which Mueller did not redact, OUT of the "admissible evidence" pile and put them into the "inadmissible evidence" pile.
* [14 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191015020809/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1183891976246222849): 12./ .... in relation to Trump being charged with obstruction ...

Mueller himself made it clear that Trump charges would have been on obstruction with Wikileaks. He said....

And the illegally* redacted material related to  @Wikileaks , the grounds for an obstruction charge.

Did he?
* [14 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191015020809/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1183891976246222849): 7/.... and it is a failure of the mainstream media that they have never asked him.

Rosenstein has never answered why he did not consider Trump for obstruction charges....
* [14 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191015020809/https://twitter.com/patribotics/status/1183891976246222849): 5/ Bill Barr said words, never contradicted by Rosenstein explicitly, implying Rosenstein agreed with his reasons for not prosecuting Trump on obstruction. But Rosenstein has never said he subscribes to Barr's legally meritless argument about 'underlying crime'.

However, we are left with the fact that Bill Barr tried to hide his ample bulk behind Rosenstein's skirts.
