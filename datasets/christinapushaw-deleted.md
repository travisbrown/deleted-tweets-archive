For political reasons, the gov could never close churches (I see it as a good thing.)

He actually uses his powers as Governor to strengthen individual rights. He doesn‚Äôt just defer to corporations like  some other ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù do.

Demings knows she would be a stronger candidate than Crist or Fried. Ultimately- No one can beat DeSantis in 2022, but any Democrat who runs against him in the general can raise their profile (and $$$$$$$$$) from the national Blue Anon community / MSNBC fan base. https://twitter.com/tampaflpolitico/status/1389573530497519621

Sometimes a plea deal allows defendant to plead ‚ÄúNo Contest‚Äù - still admitting the state has enough evidence to convict

In some areas, public schools are good; families would choose to send their kids to those public schools. Vouchers would be mostly used by families who live in areas w/substandard public options.

I said his background (being privileged) might explain why he doesn‚Äôt understand Scott‚Äôs background. Kessler‚Äôs article itself made it clear he doesn‚Äôt understand the experience of a Black person in Jim Crow SC. Do you think it was fair?

Ukraine had a very pro-Russian government before 2014. More than half the people in Ukraine speak Russian as a native language. They‚Äôre Slavic too. I think the issue was Russia‚Äôs security interest in the Black Sea to be honest

The thing is, Georgia was it‚Äôs own country prior to the USSR. It was invaded and annexed by the Soviet army. Georgians, like Russians and everyone else during the Soviet era, suffered a lot under the communist regime. They want to maintain their independence now too

I sometimes think the same thing has happened in the country of Georgia. It‚Äôs one reason I left. The US gov either doesn‚Äôt get what‚Äôs going on in situations like this, or they don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth trying to change anything. But sanctions might work!

I think maybe DC is the worst with lockdown fanatics because most people here have government jobs and aren‚Äôt as much into the arts, nightlife, culture as New Yorkers (generalization, but the stereotype exists for a reason).

Now lockdowns are normalized and even demanded by many people. This is why, despite living in big cities full of Democrats my whole life, I‚Äôve realized I need to move to a red state.

As well as unhealthy lifestyles. Sitting at home all the time is not healthy. Ordering in all the time isn‚Äôt healthy.

Just as some people suffer from CFS & different post-viral syndromes. The problem is that the symptoms of LongC are SO unspecific, it might be over diagnosed ‚Äî & other health issues may be overlooked.
* [18 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210418032432/https://twitter.com/ChristinaPushaw/status/1383614861641347079): Exactly. I believe CFS is real, and LongC is too, as are other post viral syndromes ‚Äî but because the symptoms are so non-specific, it can be way over diagnosed.
* [18 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210418034517/https://twitter.com/ChristinaPushaw/status/1383579471492440067): They might have died WITH Covid but not FROM Covid ... problem is when people don‚Äôt make that distinction

I‚Äôm wondering if that contributes to how they feel. Wish there was more research on it

My point is that I‚Äôm not sure if Covid is the cause or trigger or if there is something else going on with some people who think they have LC. There are many people with LC who never tested positive for Covid for example

Are those kind of tests done before diagnosing LC? It sounds like a lot of people just diagnose themselves, and this article didn‚Äôt give much info about how it could be diagnosed in a medical setting
* [17 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210418004802/https://twitter.com/ChristinaPushaw/status/1383532401050087426): I would not be surprised if it is. On the other hand, it‚Äôs possible that some people who think they have LC are physically ill due to other conditions ‚Äî but they just wrongly assume it‚Äôs LC. That could be a major problem in the future
* [17 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210418004916/https://twitter.com/ChristinaPushaw/status/1383538386133155847): It‚Äôs worth considering.

* [17 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210418040308/https://twitter.com/ChristinaPushaw/status/1383538491993190409): Absolutely.

I don‚Äôt want to jump to that conclusion about someone who was a nurse before getting sick though, that is not an easy job. I do think if ‚Äúlong Covid‚Äù were a qualifying disability - a lot of people would claim it

That seems highly problematic to me when there‚Äôs no set diagnostic criteria or test for this syndrome.

What if this person in the article has cancer or some other underlying condition but doesn‚Äôt get it checked out because she & her doc just assume ‚Äúlong Covid‚Äù?

The issues that the person in this article is facing do sound serious (fainting) but can be caused by MANY conditions that aren‚Äôt ‚Äúlong Covid‚Äù. It would be bad if the real cause were overlooked.

Even at the end of the USSR, the Soviet foreign minister was Georgian. It still didn‚Äôt help most Georgian people. The country suffered enormously due to the USSR and right after .

In fact, it was a multi-ethnic empire; propaganda about ‚Äúdecolonization‚Äù was used to convince ethnic minorities (ie, non-Russians in the USSR) that communism was actually good for them.

There were like 20 different ‚Äúnationalities‚Äù (officially recognized ethnicities). Soviet ideologists were obsessed with promoting facades of ‚Äúaffirmative action‚Äù & ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù (just not diversity of thought, obviously).  https://twitter.com/seanmdav/status/1382810433799782400  pic.twitter.com/Ti8frT8b0a

Cases only started spiking in October-November, peaked in winter, now back down. üíâ uptake in üá¨üá™ is VERY low for cultural reasons (& bc a 27 yr old nurse died from anaphylaxis after getting one of the first shots)

Even though most Georgians smoke cigarettes. They do eat healthy and maintain a healthy weight.

But once Covid was in the country, little could be done

And it‚Äôs not about politics IMO - hesitancy among a subgroup of white conservatives is more a function of religious beliefs I think.

People in Florida are allowed to wear masks wherever they want, and many do. It‚Äôs just not up to the state to enforce. Again, outcome of non-mandate areas compared to mandate areas speaks for itself.

People who supported her in the past&now want to minimize her to a ‚Äúfootnote‚Äùbc she‚Äôs discredited, are ignoring the fact that millions of people still believe her lies.

I actually like Larry Hogan, which might be surprising since I‚Äôm a DeSantis supporter, but Hogan has been far too interventionist & heavy handed with Covid restrictions ‚Äî especially schools.

I don‚Äôt think Desantis has been treated fairly by the media until recently. I appreciate that you criticize people in a nonpartisan manner, and I appreciate your work on public health, I just wish you wouldn‚Äôt resort to ad hominem. If I made a false statement, correct it.

My point is that Cuomo did what DeSantis is accused of doing (manipulating Covid data) & oversaw an absolutely disastrous pandemic response. Glad the media is admitting it now and glad you said so last spring, but Cuomo was a star then & Desantis was vilified

It should be published next week. This story is too convoluted for Twitter but long-form article will work. The proof that ‚ÄúTaylor‚Äù is Rebekah Jones is rock solid, so I wonder how she will try to explain this

It appears Rebekah Jones has a pattern of using fake identities online to spread rumors about herself, shill her GoFundMe‚Äôs, seek attention, and pretend to be a victim.

Rebekah Jones is exploiting these real issues for her own grift and it‚Äôs disgusting. She isn‚Äôt a victim of racism for sure, she isn‚Äôt a victim of police violence, and she sexually harassed her former student

That‚Äôs what people do when they can‚Äôt argue the facts. Is Rebekah credible?

Even Nikki Fried praised DeSantis for  #OpenSchools . Of course, Rebekah Jones is mad and posting her conspiracy theories.

No accountability or representation of Georgian people. Also when will Georgia stop being compared to other ‚Äúformer Soviet states‚Äù?

Easier than admitting why observations about Russian influence in Georgia are made ‚Äúquarterly.‚Äù Just maybe there is something to the argument? Nah - easier to dismiss with sarcasm, especially for non Georgians ;)
