Imagine being this upset to find out that there’s a black person who isn’t oppressed.   🤡🤡🤡 https://twitter.com/jackposobiec/status/1420473723937869825

Call it a “public health crisis”, not an oppressive genocidal regime.

Look at how their government is lying to the world as they slaughters their own citizens.  Look at how OUR government has lied to the world about our election and January 6th.   WAKE UP.  Fight for this country now or we will be Cuba.

This explains the many baseless conspiracies against India and Russia.  2) We persecute political dissidents. This is explains the fake insurrection on January 6th.  3) We no longer hold the moral high ground.

You are deranged.   As is any person applauding your efforts. https://twitter.com/kenklippenstein/status/1399507595577208839

If people can’t see the demonic nature of the Left teaching children to mock killing an unborn child for social media likes, then we as a society are completely.   Pray for this girl.  Pray for the unborn. pic.twitter.com/eih3BW2LgS

Try:   “Somebody left an umbrella”.   It is terrifying to me that adults do not know this and are instead trying to substantiate colloquialisms.
* [19 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210519225838/https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO/status/1395151620678332417): Announcing that your pronouns are they/them is just poor grammar.   I don’t care your reasons, please stop trying to make low academic achievement a thing.

What we are seeing here is a level of corruption that known only in third world countries.   If you didn’t cheat, why would you ever work to stop an audit of votes?

Just because you’re gay (or black) does not mean you have to vote Democrat.
* [28 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210328205850/https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO/status/1376277595587813376): It is so obvious to me that  @Nike  is a racist, anti-American corporation. Everything they promote is meant to directly harm black youth, and simultaneously inject poison into American culture.   They use black athletes and artists to accomplish this goal.
* [16 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210316210240/https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO/status/1371929785832775690): What is your obsession with the Trump family?  You are digging up modeling shots from our former First Lady from 3 decades ago. She has evolved, you have now.  What you did at the Grammy’s was disgusting.  Own it.  https://twitter.com/iamcardib/status/1371925477611294721

You are in positing to empower young women to aspire to something more than taking off their clothes but you don’t feel you can be more.
* [16 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210316175241/https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO/status/1371882089675644934) ([live](https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO/status/1371881588259225601)): Just @ me next time, directly.   You are a cancer cell to culture. Young black girls are having their minds poisoned by what you are trying to package and sell to them as “empowerment”.   I’m one of the few that has courage to tell you the truth.   You should thank me. https://twitter.com/iamcardib/status/1371709653441159171

No one is comfortable with what Derek Chauvin did. He was negligent. But we should be more discomforted with establishing precedent for sending people to prison because of how the public “feels”.   Slipperiest slope ever. https://twitter.com/realcandaceo/status/1370136836891377665
* [11 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210311030655/https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO/status/1369847246200725505): TBT to that time 2 years ago, BEFORE  #Megxit  when Meghan Markle said she didn’t read any news articles about herself or use social media.  Now the story is the press made her so suicidal she had to leave the U.K  She’s a compulsive liar who should be dragged for days.   #SaveHarry  https://twitter.com/itvnews/status/1104062977618132992

There’s really no other way to say it.  Bad press over bridesmaid dresses does not make you want to kill yourself and your unborn child unless you are:   A) Unstable B) Lying for sympathy C) Both https://twitter.com/therightmelissa/status/1369660081328058369

He never kowtows to the Left.    #CPAC2021   #CPAC

This is Washington DC, a few blocks from where the President of the United States resides.
* [ 4 February 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210204011325/https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO/status/1357135103479152646): It’s an empty parking lot. AOC staged a photo shoot in front of an empty parking lot.  What do I need to retract?   She saw no children in cages despite her tweets to the contrary.  Unless you have more photos? https://twitter.com/waltshaub/status/1357113863158853633

CNN is already beginning to call Redditors anti-Semitic white supremacists.   They are setting the stage to give the wealthy, hedge fund elites their billions back.   This is sick stuff but they’ve been doing it for years to Trump supporters. pic.twitter.com/XMop47TcGV

Surely  @TwitterSafety  will use the same standard they have applied heavily across conservative accounts for inciting violence.
* [27 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210127150518/https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO/status/1354445354331205632) ([live](https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO/status/1354444587641794568)): Can anyone explain to me why  @twitter  is not fact-checking this post? Shouldn’t our  @FBI  investigate this for “inciting violence”?   This is a LIE and ANTIFA has attempted to murder ICE agents in the past due to lies like these.   A federal judge has halted the order—NOT ICE. https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1354211627940384768

Seems relevant.  Has any “journalist” done a report on how each person who has been arrested was registered— or do we not want facts to get in the way of a good story... https://twitter.com/nytmetro/status/1349114952469139458
