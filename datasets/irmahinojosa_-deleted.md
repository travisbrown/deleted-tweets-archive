These are the “educators” telling your non black kids they are racist turning a blind eye towards homicide statistics. I’m glad school is closed. I hope a large percentage of parents continue to homeschool after this shutdown. pic.twitter.com/zssOEXW3Mw

It’s so concerning and overwhelming sometimes, I pray that the Lord gives us strength and guidance.

It’s unnatural. You would sooner find nicer manufactured homes for 10% of that price & find a multiple acre lot with large trees. Our kids deserve to be able to play outdoors. https://twitter.com/thefaceberg/status/1257211095472898048

Being White however, there is a constant reminder at every turn that you are an oppressor, a racist at heart & even your newborn babies are racist. You must pay  for every wrong in humanity.   #ItsOkayToBeWhite

They go down a rabbit hole seeing things that scar them for life & eventually ruin relationships. Porn must be banned entirely. If you defend it you’re either an idiot or addict.

Where are all the Hollywood movies about this? Why isn’t this ever mentioned? Maybe it’s not considered a tragedy when Goyim die.

Voted Trump? Literally Hitler. The moral mythos at the center of the country is that narrative & if we don’t confront it they’ll continue to beat us over the head with it & degeneracy will continue to win. pic.twitter.com/8wf93a2mWj

Tim just wants to deflect and downplay his behavior when he should apologize. I can only hope deep down he knows it.

You’re the one who doxxed people. This has nothing to do with anything. You didn’t threaten him over this and if you think this justifies your threats of violence and doxxing then you’re not a Catholic. You’re an unstable merchant. Repent.

We had something amazing growing in California but that couldn’t be allowed to continue.

I’ve learned all these basic Conservatives are controlled & one dare not interfere with their cash flow.

Perhaps the worse form of emotional manipulation yet. The only way to make things right is to check your privilege & be the savior of minorities at the expense of their own race & traditions.
* [28 April 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180428235151/https://twitter.com/irmahinojosa_/status/990267755759730689): Democrats have Black people in a permanent oppression unable to persevere because “Republicans & White people don’t let them.” What an evil thing to do to a race you didn’t want off the plantation & still don’t.

They emotionally manipulate us into thinking we can’t advance unless we’re Democrat because no one else cares about us & will keep us down. It’s sick.

All of a sudden Trump isn’t Russia’s puppet & we have to bomb Syria & go to war with a nuclear superpower for Israel.
