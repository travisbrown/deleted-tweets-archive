* [27 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201227225631/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1343329750085939203): Same vibe as the church that has rock bands and BLM vigils.  Trying so hard to appeal to "the youth" by copying mainstream culture that they lose everything that makes them distinct.
* [24 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201224163202/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1342145945379745795): I'd be afraid of germs too if I was always getting sick!
* [23 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201223185000/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1341817765699735557): It's not inherently pro-life, it just doesn't necessarily conflict.   It's perfectly coherent to think:  "Abortion is an evil act of murder, but distributing condoms to the poor is good- it will help them choose when to have kids, and those choices will improve humanity's genes."
* [23 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201223184638/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1341816679400148993): True! Just pointing out that historical figures are complex and rarely fit neatly into modern categories.   I'm not interested in canceling Sanger either way, so I haven't looked into it deeply.   Imo PP needs to stand or fall on what they do today, not who their founder was.
* [23 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201223185000/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1341817765699735557) ([live](https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1341810801921961984)): They could both be true.   Most of the nasty quotes I've seen from her are either racist or pro-eugenics, neither of which prevents someone from being pro life or using civil disobedience to help people access contraception.
* [16 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201216223738/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1339337991114944516): Depends how you mean "standing".  The procedure seems completely constitutional: no electoral majority, vote goes to the House, House selects Adams.  Adams giving out Cabinet appointments to prominent Reps who supported him definitely looks corrupt, so in that sense I agree.
* [16 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201216222235/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1339335009833021446): Andrew Jackson in 1825 through 1828?  He claimed to have been fraudulently denied the presidency, and started his '28 campaign pretty much immediately after the '24 election was concluded.
* [ 3 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201203073401/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1334400428356882440): Follow back  @iamnoah
* [24 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201124103611/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1331184534927380481): The tiger  He destroyed his cage  Yes  YES  The tiger is out
* [ 4 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201104233233/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1324132368354082816): Which I struggled a little to fully articulate in the initial tweet
* [ 4 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201104233152/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1324132224514613255): Even if people are generally foolish stubborn, inflexible, etc.  We would expect them to fairly regularly make changes that improve their wisdom and outlook, given some basic and (imo) reasonable assumptions about how people can change.
* [ 4 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201104233034/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1324131894125056001): My original point is really two pieces:   1. People who do change generally follow an existing example or philosophy  2. Wisdom is often very helpful to those who possess it, so many of the existing examples that exist to be followed include valuable wisdom  Therefore-
* [ 4 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201104232102/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1324129509671686151): Usually when I think of someone in real life improving their wisdom and outlook it manifests more as being able to better accomplish their goals, drawing more satisfaction from what they have, or making their relationships deeper and more meaningful.
* [ 4 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201104231916/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1324129066472083458): I agree that standing up to your community when it's doing something wrong can require wisdom, but it doesn't seem like the most common form of wisdom we encounter.
* [ 4 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201104211726/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1324098357762138117): Maybe they're a fictional blueprint from a scifi book, maybe you don't have the right tools or materials.  Maybe you end up with a motorcycle when you need a minivan.   But almost all the available plans are there because they were useful to someone.
* [ 4 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201104211726/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1324098357762138117) ([live](https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1324097689483694081)): Probably true if we assume people invent all their own views from the ground up every time.   I think generally people draw their philosophies and attitudes from existing cultural narratives though.  I think a better analogy would be grabbing a random set of blueprints for a car.
* [ 4 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201104211726/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1324098357762138117) ([live](https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1324095592977600513)): What fraction of changes in outlook would you expect to look like improvements in wisdom, assuming all such changes were completely random?
* [27 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201027140705/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1321090697953497088): According to that chart around 5% of 70+s will neither die nor survive, so apparently a state of eternal undeath is a possible outcome.   Possibly a plague of covid zombies?  (Or they threw a % sign on a decimal fatality rate, mis-stating lethality by two orders of magnitude)
* [12 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201012184056/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1315724087428169728): MAXIMUM BULK  Also working neck.
* [ 7 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201007074117/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1313730813268127744): Based pic.twitter.com/R7dBWCHHHo
* [ 4 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201006010044/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1312857599474241536): I believe the theory is that Bloom has a hypothesis about who BAP is, but doesn't know for sure.   He can then look through all FOIA requests relating to (hypothesized name), and if the hypothesized person has made such a request he has confirmation.
* [18 September 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200918142852/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1306962565944180747): @antipedaction  https://twitter.com/nytimesworld/status/1306938546704519169
* [13 September 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200913231736/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1305284405552795649): Depends what is meant by "real" knowledge vs other sorts of knowledge.   Seems reasonable to say: "We know that historical records are sometimes falsified, therefore written words alone are insufficient for absolute certainty."  Unreasonable to say history provides no evidence.
* [ 1 September 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901162849/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1300832407583559680): Personally I think the whole thing is a confusing unnecessary mess. After all, we don't have a separate special census category for any other language group.  I get the sense that "Mestizo" sounds vaguely racist to most people though, so we're probably stuck with "Hispanic".
* [ 1 September 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901153249/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1300818614472159238): So "white Hispanic" is a completely valid category.   That said, the officer in question clearly isn't white.
* [ 1 September 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901153249/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1300818614472159238) ([live](https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1300817604689276929)): Hispanic is defined by language and national origin, as your graphic shows, not race.   Racially, most Hispanics are a mix of Euro, Amerindian, and black. There are plenty of Hispanics who are mostly or entirely white European by ancestry, in both Spain and S America.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824053258/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1297768659075477504): Army Realism Drill: get in the back of a truck and ride around a few hours while referees set off fireworks nearby.   There are no targets and you get DQed if you fire your rifle.   Winner is the guy who's done it six times already without DQ and can do 40 pushups.
* [ 8 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200608093708/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1269817024265564160): I'm impressed that so many non-gun-owners are managing to shoot themselves tbh.
* [ 5 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200605055220/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1268781386862862338): Because they're not all white- rather, they're mixed between other races. Some are counted as white, some as black, some as native, other into uncategorized or other.
* [ 5 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200605055220/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1268781386862862338) ([live](https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1268726471197184000)): No, they're categorized as either white or black (generally).   The government has a weird way of doing races where black, white, and asian are "races" but Hispanic is an "ethnicity".  It's how you get "White Hispanic" or "Non-Hispanic White" etc.
* [ 4 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200605055220/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1268781386862862338) ([live](https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1268344737767055367)): One reason is that the two tables you're comparing use different racial categories. The arrest data excludes Hispanics; the victim survey breaks them out as a separate category.  Check out the offender vs arrestee tables here:  https://ucr.fbi.gov/nibrs/2018/tables/data-tables   They match closely.
* [26 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200526055938/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1265156667152490503): Publicly-traded commercial enterprises no; religious organizations, nonprofits, small and family business yes.
* [14 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200514114939/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1260873615102423045): Rock always wins pic.twitter.com/a5w6rnCgFx
* [10 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200410015207/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1248427732976861186): I believe its an American POW in Vietnam- making a taped statement while in captivity about how well the prisoners were being treated, blinking "TORTURE" in Morse code.
* [18 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200318042142/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1240121812396187649): And inflation is a real risk, and can be tremendously damaging if it gets out of hand, so their concern is understandable.  But I don't think it fits in a situation like this.
* [18 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200318035023/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1240121572029083654): I think a lot of people on the conservative side have a reflexive distaste for government handouts, so they just reach for whatever argument is at hand to try to shut them down.
* [18 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200318035023/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1240121572029083654): I think we're in more of the latter situation now.   The inflation argument that people often make doesn't apply specially to people and not to banks, so its not really an answer here.
* [18 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200318060256/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1240120267063558146): For regular economic stimulus, you absolutely could do exactly that.   Bank bailouts are usually justified by some imminent threat to the banking system (like the 2008 crisis). For a regular economic slowdown, giving money to people works just as well, or even better.
* [18 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200318060256/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1240120267063558146): This argument hinges on lending being a positive good, essential even, in the business context. You'll have to judge that one for yourself.
* [18 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200318040012/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1240120166945619968): For (2), the mainstream justification for bank bailouts is usually that lending is vitally important to the economy. If banks go under they can't loan to businesses, and businesses can't function without loans, so the whole economy grinds to a halt.
* [18 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200318054454/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1240120109118697480): Mainstream view is that inflation isn't a huge worry. There are lots of other factors that affect prices, and with inflation currently low there isn't a huge concern that either YangBux or bank bailouts will cause runaway inflation.
* [18 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200318070208/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1240120067418923009): Inflation effectively acts as redistribution from creditors to debtors when the loans aren't pegged to inflation (as is the case with most mortgages and car payments)
* [18 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200318070208/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1240120067418923009): The "inflation" argument is really about (1). All else equal prices will rise if we add more money to circulation. As you note this won't completely wipe out individual gains.
* [18 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200318070208/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1240120067418923009): There's really two separate questions here: 1. Should we give out huge piles of cash? 2. If so, should we give them to banks or to people
* [ 9 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200309202732/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1237112329327841285): "Zercher Press" has a certain ring to it.  An air of mystery too: anyone who knows what a Zercher squat is will immediately wonder how such a thing is possible.
* [26 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200226035058/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1232509669354168320): I think Randbot got banned or suspended- I'm not sure if he's on twitter but  @TheRalphRetort  would know more about the situation.
* [11 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200212045250/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1227349763508576259): Sources close to the matter tell me an upcoming executive order will require all federal buildings to be in the neolithic style.
* [28 January 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200130000305/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1222201270909444103): I could see easily cutting around half of the budget and personnel for the Army and Marines in this scenario, especially if we scale back our presence in Japan and Germany.  In that case we could invest MORE in naval, air, and missile supremacy and still hit the 20% target.
* [28 January 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200130000305/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1222201270909444103): The key in my view is changing mission- while it would be difficult to make major cuts and still accomplish everything we do today, if we end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan there's suddenly a ton of slack in the budget, both in terms of money and personnel.
* [24 January 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200124193644/https://twitter.com/marcus_drusus/status/1220786815285760001): How did Dr Michael respond though?   The people need a resolution!

The memory tests used for all of these are fairly different from traditional intelligence tests, probably not particularly useful for assessing intelligence.    https://www.gwern.net/docs/algernon/2009-silberberg.pdf

Familiarity with the task is key. Original study had trained chimps vs humans seeing the test for the first time. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-008-0206-8

Someone else is speaking!  Mysterious forces are at play...
