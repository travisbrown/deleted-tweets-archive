I‚Äôm citing it to show you that they are (as St Paul said) ‚Äúprohibiting us from speaking to the gentiles‚Äù.  Today Anti-semitism is anything spoken or written that Jews don‚Äôt like.  It used to mean biological determinism.

The argument is that as a created being, you owe your existence to a creator, which is a reality. How you internalize this reality, and then manifest it is expressed through religion.

Being white is accidental, and not essential to your identity.

Knowing that attacking christianity directly would be difficult and highly un-optical, this attack was guised under the cover of racial justice.

In Tanzania there are over 51 different ethnicities that war with, enslave and are at odds with one another. Their ‚Äúblackness‚Äù is not a meaningful material category with which to observe their behavior.

* [22 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191122053558/https://twitter.com/realDaveReilly/status/1197747793873588225): However, after seeing with my own eyes, the way in which young white men like myself were mercilessly and ruthlessly struck down, I began questioning what it means to be white, and what a ‚Äúwhite identity‚Äù really means.

In 2012 I hit bottom and after an awakening and a serious amount of research, I became Catholic.

But Hungarian culture and Irish culture are COMPLETELY different.  White dosen't inherently have *A* culture. There are many white cultures, just like there are many white nations.

German is a language, and Germany's religion is Protestant or Catholic.  The Irish have a language/dialect and their religion is Catholic.  "Whites" came into being when Catholic ethnics moved to the suburbs and had amnesia.
* [22 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191122010507/https://twitter.com/realDaveReilly/status/1197672630695936002): Being "black" didn't mean what it means colloquially in society today until Hollywood and the Media confected the identity, and the socially engineered inner city types adopted this fake identity, and left behind any semblance of a real identity.
* [22 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191122010507/https://twitter.com/realDaveReilly/status/1197672630695936002): You could definitely do the same thing with "black," but you could not do that to "Jew." This is not only a religion, but an ethnicity with a common language (Yiddish/"Hebrew").   Again, it comes down to defining terms.
* [22 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191122005929/https://twitter.com/realDaveReilly/status/1197672111122325506): You should read my article in the upcoming mag called Generation Identity Crisis...  It'll shed some light on this.  We're saying the same thing, but using different language. We have to define our terms and refine our language to have a productive conversation.

It‚Äôs a category used by sociologists to analyze and quantify social behavior of large groups of people. It has largely been defined by academe and the media, and has no real historical reality.

There is the will and the intellect, belief is what happens when the will moves the intellect to something. Weather or not you are aware you have made a choice is another thing.

Belief however does not make something true.  Truth is the adequation of the mind to an extra-mental reality.   You can believe anything you like, but belief in something does not make it true.

Radical immigration policy, leading to a flood of immigrants of any religion, skin color or ethnicity into an area that does share the same produces conflict.
