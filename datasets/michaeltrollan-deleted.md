Meanwhile he talked about how his motorcycle had been damaged and stolen multiple times, and waved goodbye as he entered the freshly installed bars on his front door.

* [ 8 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210909020050/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1435640580042747910): That is amazing.
* [ 8 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210909014402/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1435638968234569729): Another hero is stepping up to fight for universal human rights. Thank you for everything you are doing,   @peterboghossian  – We stand behind you! https://twitter.com/peterboghossian/status/1435576254074220552
* [ 8 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210909014814/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1435638122172149765): The insanity continues. https://twitter.com/burns_law/status/1435496271498956801
* [ 5 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210905224649/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1434649224617021452): Well said.   Too many people think they can fix racism with racism.   We need unity and humanity, not division and hatred.
* [ 5 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210905224452/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1434648695346278402): Translation of this tweet: "Any criticism of white supremacy claims is proof of white supremacy!"  It's insane circular logic.
* [ 4 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210904131251/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1434136270087786500): Just one quibble here: measuring a school by quota of skin color or gender isn't a fair system. If more Asian students (or any category) are succeeding at math class, we shouldn't turn good students away in favor of bad students because they have the wrong skin color.
* [ 1 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210901134524/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1433040578413936644): People fear speaking up against CRT for fear of being labeled racist. Ironic.   Combined with the way true CRT believers will attack and vilify anyone who opposes them, all while under the protective cover of naive people who think CRT just means "teaching about slavery".
* [ 1 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210901133643/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1433039466642296832): This just proves my point. You are ok with Heather explaining things, because she is a woman. You are not ok with me explaining things because I'm a man.
* [ 1 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210901115811/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1433019695301464067): It's interesting to think about family being a powerful historical source of community, in contrast to modern society with much to offer beyond bloodlines.  What is the right balance? Which direction should we strive toward? Can both be enhanced at the same time? https://twitter.com/josephvaloren/status/1432746730785845248
* [ 1 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210901113801/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1433013288304930816): Racist, much? As if only "white males" ever do such things.
* [ 1 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210901113800/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1433012850499280902): Heather, the term "mansplaining" is sexist. Not all men talk at people, and not all women *don't* talk at people.  Criticize the specific activity, not entire categories of people.
* [ 1 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210901100920/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1432994523978682369): Only someone who hasn't owned a rental property could ever think that it's not production. A ton of work goes into it, from marketing to maintenance to improvements and more.
* [ 1 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210901100920/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1432994523978682369): Seems "CockAnon" is missing some basic economics.   Housing developers are motivated to build when there are buyers to buy the homes.  Buyers don't prevent anyone from building. Regulations do. Eliminate those, instead of demonizing buyers and proving the original point.
* [27 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210827232546/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1431396240449687554): That's the romantic way of describing it. Unfortunately they also think logic, reason, and even science are just subjective and should be rejected. "Tools of the oppressor" as adherents too often put it. https://twitter.com/JDHaltigan/status/1431363551650881536
* [27 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210827232310/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1431396041245425665): That's the romantic way of describing it. Unfortunately they also think logic, reason, and even science are just subjective and should be rejected. "Tools of the oppressor" as adherents too often put it.
* [27 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210827000146/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1431044028171046917): It's nice to see Sam admitting misjudgement. Everyone makes mistakes, especially if you've whipped yourself into a TDS frenzy. Disappointing that we've jumped out of the frying pan into the fire.
* [26 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210826203618/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1430982132516544519): And notice how the trick is to change the definitions. They'll say: "When I say God, what I mean is the beauty of the universe." Or they'll say "When we say female, what we mean is feeling like a female; that has nothing to do with your genes or genitals."
* [11 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210811223409/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1425586303362473986): Ordered.   Excellent reviews by amazing people.
* [27 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210727223231/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1420150097388589057): Not a single thoughtful critic of CRT -- and there are many -- is afraid of black liberation. In fact, they are unanimously in favor of black success (and for that matter, asian success, white success, etc etc.).
* [26 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210726155834/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1419688516443807745): It should always be a huge red flag whenever you aren't allowed to openly discuss a topic. pic.twitter.com/lllqEqpnhh
* [23 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210723203213/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1418670291589472259): It's a play on someone who said Bloomberg could have given $1 Million to everyone instead of running his campaign.
* [23 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210723203055/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1418669941532905474): pic.twitter.com/7z2Pn4M3v4
* [20 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210720234114/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1417630509329313796): That's a glimmer of hope. Though frankly the book title is already unforgivably racist.
* [20 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210720142844/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1417490979695775748): Just wow.   You know, if you find yourself surrounded by people that openly judge everyone by their skin color, rather than by the content of their character, it might be time to consider a new friend group. Neo-racists are no better than racists--just better at rationalizing.
* [20 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210720014225/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1417298716021559297): Did you literally go through and count how many white males you have at the company?
* [20 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210720014222/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1417298685382201352): One thing is for sure: judging people by their skin color isn't how you solve racism.
* [16 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210716212538/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1416146978010894336): Threatening an atheist with hell is like a hippy threatening to punch you in the aura.
* [11 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210711022756/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1414048751459586049): Zoom zoom!
* [10 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210710162226/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1413896358109466632): Accurate
* [27 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210627123151/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1409127253578031107): Seconding this. I only go to google every now and then for searches that are more specialized.
* [27 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210627123121/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1409127048824643587): I'm right there with you. I've been using DuckDuckGo as my main search engine for about a year now.
* [26 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210626155125/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1408815118310281219): "Killing it" is not acceptable at Brandeis. https://twitter.com/wokenewsnet/status/1408587086941147136
* [24 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210624002930/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1407858307893628936): Neo-racist author, Ibram X. Kendi.
* [18 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210618203502/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1405969044260278273): Having only read your article so far (not the "further reading"), which parts of CRT did you find potentially useful and accurate?
* [11 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210611091225/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1403278787131891715): Insert "business", "stocks", or anything else in place of house. Maybe it's your first investment home after years of saving up. Either way, completely senseless to tax unrealized gains.
* [10 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210610200308/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1403063462717186052): Excellent point. Most everyone I know who selflessly cares about fairness, equality, and humanity has seen that the woke approach runs counter to those values.   Whereas most everyone I know who is exploiting it, or emotional about it, or is seeking revenge, remains woke.
* [10 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210610022240/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1402810556927647747): Definitely imaginary. pic.twitter.com/Lz6QhTw0ua
* [10 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210610022240/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1402810556927647747): Yep, totally no rise at all. /s pic.twitter.com/DK9HnjOSXf
* [10 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210610011342/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1402789166312738818): Yes. Prior to the rise of the woke left, he spent far more time challenging dogma coming from the religious right.
* [10 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210610012541/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1402788896228974592): Aside from an algorithm boost leading to more visibility, one very concrete ending is that you get a separate, blue-checkmark-only direct message inbox. It makes other blue checkmarks far more likely to see your DMs. Among other things.
* [10 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210610004129/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1402787862165217282): For a while, they did give out checkmarks to most people. Then they stopped doing it.   Regardless of whether it's 100% only lefties who get the checkmarks recently, it certainly seems that the majority of people who are being denied are not woke.
* [10 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210610015709/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1402786899723489282): Meanwhile, as  @Dataracer117  pointed out, this profile is verified. pic.twitter.com/Vb4M6HGbol
* [ 9 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210609140239/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1402622856182255616): Couldn't agree more. This notion that "anything the right says is wrong" is causing otherwise reasonable left-wing people to willfully avoid understanding the reality around them.
* [ 9 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210609140705/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1402615716692611078): Case in point, Anna Paulina Luna. 200k followers, nearly won her election for United States House of Representatives.   No checkmark. pic.twitter.com/AhSIobz8n3
* [ 9 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210609140025/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1402614588420628482): Definitely ideological.   People very few followers, who are not in the news, but who agree with woke politics have blue checkmarks.  Meanwhile, there are actual candidates for United States Congress who won their primary who don't have the checkmarks. Only Republicans though.
* [ 9 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210609155351/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1402613898931589120): Spot on. They paid far more than I would expect, actually.  Paying low taxes is not hard: spend your money on activities society has agreed not to tax, like business expenses (spurring economonic activity and jobs) or charity (money being spent to improve the world).
* [ 9 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210609131008/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1402613281206980608): The ProPublica article is embarrassing. How can they have so little understanding of how taxes work? Virtually all developed countries in the world don't tax unrealized capital gains. For good reason.  This article has a good breakdown: https://savingjournalism.substack.com/p/propublicas-bombshell-bullshit-tax
* [ 9 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210609125245/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1402608457887453184): In fact, it would be insane to tax wealth. Imagine you only make 30k and for years save enough to buy a 100k home. Then, your neighborhood gets popular and your home value goes to 200k. You'd get a bill for 30k on your "+100k of wealth" that year. How could you possibly pay that?
* [ 8 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210608171524/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1402309681822015492): That is disappointing to see.  I strongly suspect he hasn't familiarized himself with CRT. He's not normally the type to think that "be less white" or "the problem with white women" are acceptable things to teach.  CRT attempts to fix racism with racism.
* [ 3 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210603191647/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1400530377979006976): We've forgotten the values of forgiveness and redemption.
* [25 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525173208/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1397244034662424579): It's obviously wrong for near-monopolies to silence people. Until a better solution is found, this one is reasonable.
* [22 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210522042557/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1395916443934466048): This may come as a shock to you, but voters vary in what they want.
* [19 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210520034739/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1395166590539378695): True. Somewhere around an elementary school level.
* [15 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210515134559/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1393560532511334400): Go Peter!
* [ 9 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210509122126/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1391367526123192321): If we're being honest, we make criticisms along those lines and continue ongoing work to improve it, meanwhile also acknowledging that it's the best known system by quite a wide margin.
* [ 9 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210509115052/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1391359936517521408): Proponents of capitalism don't complain that it hasn't been done right yet. Instead, they point to the many, many successful countries.   It's true that no system is perfect, but one is clearly much much more successful than the other in practice
* [ 1 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210502010536/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1388501407846780930): White Fragility by Robin Di'Angelo, for one.   The philosopher Michel Foucault, if they're really serious.
* [ 1 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210501125538/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1388477003406487552): Right there with you Michael.   I have spent time with US conservatives over the past couple of years, and they work hard for things like freedom of speech, *not* judging people by skin color, having capitalism not socialism, etc.   Lately the left fights *against* those things.
* [29 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429183541/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1387837912662872065): Next to no one on the right thinks other people's masks make them uncomfortable.
* [28 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210428032904/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1387247374154743808): Yes. We should all be defending free speech.  If we only defend it when our side is losing, and attack it when our side is winning, then it might not be there at all the next time our side is losing.
* [27 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210427174635/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1387083533299093507): "We make project management, team communication, and email software. We are not a social impact company." "Employees are free to take up whatever cause they want...and speak out on whatever horrible injustices are being perpetrated on this group or that." https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5
* [27 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210427001436/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1386836080180318209): They absolutely do. You just only hear when they surrender peacefully.
* [26 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210426184712/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1386753620813697035): This interaction has nothing to do with race.  Making it about race is the only racism here.  Tariq, you should be ashamed of yourself.
* [25 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210425201528/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1386413515561439232): Tulsi Gabbard is pro-human. Beautiful message. https://twitter.com/tulsigabbard/status/1386283094274097154
* [23 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210423103238/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1385541941299908610): No there isn't. Freedom of speech means freedom of speech. Not freedom to only say what the orthodoxy thinks is acceptable to say. pic.twitter.com/FA9mcyRf7v
* [22 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210422203007/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1385330031086522371): Someone once said to me "Twitter is for dunking on people."   Seems to be true, considering that it's basically the equivalent of having a discussion with news headlines only.
* [22 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210422201336/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1385325939157053444): RT @SwipeWright: The problem isn't religion, it's dogma. Any ideology that punishes those who question their tenets will never end well.
* [22 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210422122507/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1385207860263587843): Well said.

It's the opposite of scientific inquiry, open-mindedness, tolerance, understanding, and humanity.

Let's support those parents in the fight!

Unfortunately it's not the case for everyone. A close friend of mine was stabbed multiple times with a knife after he came out as an atheist. I know children who are ejected from their homes for it. The list is long.

For most people, the a-word came with scowling disapproval at best, but more likely ostracization, threats, and abuse.
* [31 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210331224824/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1377392209708773377): The idiocy here is interpreting it to mean "you can't be interested in truth and the role of meaning in human life". That is not, for one second, what Dawkins is saying.
* [31 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210331222453/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1377386389092794370): As recently as five years ago, liberals and conservatives agreed on the fundamentals of the USA: capitalism is the best choice, freedom of speech matters, and truth is objectively discoverable through science and reason.   Then came along wokeism, and silenced those liberals.
* [31 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210331010135/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1377063304112263173): Excellent point. The alliances should be around "truth is above all else, especially power." There is common ground there between liberals and conservatives, atheists and the religious.
* [31 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210331005411/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1377061567271997446): People who intimidate scientists for political reasons. In this case, trans activists.

* [23 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210323030507/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1374195364459339781): Spot on. Science is only science if it follows the evidence where it leads.   People who stifle evidence they don't like aren't on the side of science, and we all stand together against them.

It makes the Oxford definition look reasonable in comparison, even though Oxford sounds like it is written by activists. Language like the "inability" to recognize the "dignity" and "value" of races can be intentionally vague.

I suspect it's faaar less true than you have been led to think.  But swapping claims is probably not productive. In case you are open-minded though, have a listen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq6xJ2vFlaA

It's pretty clear we are entirely too far apart on the topic, to have much hope of productive discourse.  Best of luck to you. May you never be judged for things you can't change about yourself – the root of what's wrong with racism.
* [19 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210319181806/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1372975645374963717): People should succeed or fail *regardless* of their skin color. The problem is pinpointed quite simply: when you judge someone by their skin color, you are the racist.
* [19 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210319181456/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1372974858842308610): What I see is a group of people attributing everything negative to skin color.  People dont choose their skin color. You can talk about making a society even more welcoming to new ideas than it already is, but to attribute everything negative to skin color is perpetuating racism.
* [19 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210319181101/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1372973642989068294): I've spent decades trying to talk reason to fundamentalist religious believers. They use vague generalities like this as well. It's sad to see that a new dogmatic religion has been born this decade.
* [19 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210319181135/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1372973116092190737): On the contrary. The fact that individuals succeed or fail despite their skin color is all the proof we need that this model is false.  Otherwise, you enter very dark territory, which has been trodden on by racists of the past. You'll be in their company.
* [19 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210319180522/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1372971920241594368): When there are specific examples of individuals being held back because of their race, we'll all be able to stand together shoulder-to-shoulder to oppose it. The vague "systematic racism" conspiracy theory is unproductive, and judging people by their skin color is racism.
* [19 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210319180230/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1372971672689594376): If being able to succeed within a culture or system crosses racial lines, as it obviously does, why use race as a stand-in when it's clearly not the actual issue? Let's talk about poverty, education, fairness, opportunity.
* [19 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210319175837/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1372970644233666560): We should call that what it is: "dominant culture" or "mainstream culture".  Every culture adopts ideas and norms which are sensible to the people within them. Attributing these to skin color is unhelpful and divisive. Not to mention racist.
* [19 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210319174433/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1372967104849313794): "Based on current trends"

From the outside, it sounds like this: "If you redefine the term, e.g. 'Whiteness is a system of diseases that people contract upon contact with other humans' and then say that it shortens lifespan, then it's true!"  Doesn't seem helpful.
* [19 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210319165255/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1372954156072321031): I was wondering when they were going to take over and change the definition. This isn't the mainstream definition of the term, it's the activist one.

It shortens life expectancies, pollutes the air", etc?  If not, it may be worth considering that it's not the other people here who are equivocating.
* [19 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210319164942/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1372953386732163075): This is the biggest conspiracy theory going. They won't be able to isolate "white supremacy" because it's not at all rampant like they portray it to be. Most of the people they call white supremacists are opposed to white supremacy.
* [19 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210319164657/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1372952646848503814): It's deeply disturbing that the Atlanta shooting is being made out to be about race. Far too many articles are doing that. Some people still insist on making it about race even after seeing that it's not.

Reason being, they wouldn't think that the simulators are at all likely to hear a prayer — unlike religious people who often believe that god is listening to every person all at the same time.

What people don't want is the tradeoffs you'd enact in order to enforce such a perfect, zero-crime society.  It would be straight out of 1984, and if history is a guide, millions would die in the process.

The term has been kept on life support by people who rarely ever step foot outside their worldview, and want an imaginary bogeyman to hate.

Once the far left took over the dialogue and began literally banning any other viewpoint, it became clear that freedom of speech as a value is a top priority. It's a human right, and we should all speak out and take risks to defend it.

It's all well and good when your personal beliefs happen to align with the popular ones. But societal norms shift.  You won't always be on the side of popular opinion. pic.twitter.com/erpnm2NuT0

If atheism is correct that there is no God, you gain a deep appreciation of the one life we know we have.

We'd like the best arguments for God too. Only with the best arguments & evidence can anyone truly justify conclusions.   We think we can show how cells led to RNA, then DNA. But we admit not knowing how the earliest cells formed.

If you actually care about people's lives, you would take a tack that will actually convince people. As you can see by Dave's reaction, you weren't. Hopefully you were able to walk it back in your DM.

"What the fuck is wrong with you" is right up there with name-calling.  Make your arguments instead. You won't persuade anyone with hysteria.

Over 10M emails sent.

Claiming that not voting your way is to vote "against democracy" and "for voter suppression" is the height of hubris and misinformation.

If you're skeptical of that, read the replies from supporters, full of hatred and anger toward men and white people.   This is not the answer. Dividing people by race and sex has been done before, and it's never ended well.

Seems to boil down to perception of the size of the danger.  It appears to hinge on whether one thinks there's more Antifa and BLM violence, or more Nazi and white supremacist violence. And which of the extremes has more influence on the public discourse.
* [ 1 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201002230847/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1311700811538485250): Quite the opposite.

That isn't what happened with the Supreme Court nomination.   Bringing it up in that context, as you have done, is the actual racism.

It's not possible. This is why all police departments approve deadly force as soon as a suspect reaches.

The people organizing the dates, printing and passing out flyers, making websites, standing on platforms with megaphones making statements definitely aren't leaders. Just bystanders, right?  I'd explain the fascism, but you have a finger in each ear.

They claim to be anti-fascist (antifa) yet are more fascistic than most of their enemies.  What is the point of saying Antifa isn't an organization? Actual white supremacists aren't an organization either. So what?

There are some examples though.   One that sticks with me was when they blocked autocomplete for "why are women so..." while leaving "why are men so" with words like stupid, selfish, mean.

The purpose of that is to demonstrate how frequently those three words appear *in exactly that order*. Considering that vast difference in frequency, it's very likely that the algorithm automatically picked up the more frequent one.

Adherents literally say science & reason are not usable because everything is subjective opinion.  In practice, it's used to discard any fact that opposes their preferred narratives (while keeping the supporting facts).  Tyranny is the perfect word for the outcome.

Free speech, free market, civil liberties... it's gone off the rails. Sounds like you've seen it too, though not bad enough yet to have hit a breaking point. Out of curiosity, what would be too much?

Because of that, the bizarre stuff has already long since become mainstream. That's the problem.   "Defund police" is mainstream. The smirking Covington kids being "racist" was mainstream. I see it every day in my personal life too.

The vast majority of conservatives were completely welcoming of our *Atheist* booth.   Times have changed dramatically in the last five years.

If you value due process, free speech, NOT discriminating by skin color or gender, standing up for the rights of every individual, and many more along these lines -- the far left (and the complacent left) should be horrifying right now.

Look, this thread is full of both women and men making claims about the other sex. Everyone gets parts wrong, of course, but all should be free to pontificate without having their viewpoint undermined by their sex, which they didn't choose.

You'd be amazed to see that it's not actually Good (the left) vs. Evil (the right).  I wish you could see it, too.

That was actually a nice approach that I'll have to use again to quickly avoid wasting breath with folks who have so completely inundated themselves with one viewpoint that they now accept most everything their side says uncritically, & believe their side can do no wrong.

Do you think it curtails free expression in even the slightest way when online mobs get people fired for, say, something they said when they were a teenager?
* [ 4 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200804005155/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1290450243813814274): Or more accurately, you'll try to say how it's not curtailing free expression to punish people for voicing their opinion, or some other such dodge.  Hopefully I'm wrong about you, and you'll be the exception. I just have no reason to think that you will.
* [ 4 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200804004920/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1290449624667435011): I can name a thousand examples. If I had even the slightest belief that it would be worth the effort to type them.  I'm sure you'll just point out the grammar mistakes and go back to the echo chamber. It's disheartening, to be honest.

But it's not reflecting reality.
* [ 4 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200804004517/https://twitter.com/michaeltrollan/status/1290448575462285312): For the sake of long shots, I'll bite:  The left in the U.S. has a near total takeover of the education system (K -> Uni), huge majority in Hollywood, the United States House of Representatives, vast footholds in corporations, & is poised with a shot at the Presidency and Senate.

And I'm sure your own side isn't doing anything extreme; you know, rolling back human rights like freedom of expression, due process, etc -- and at a much larger scale.  All in response to the overblown specter.

Imagine if we hadn't allowed debate for the evolution, or heliocentrism, etc.   Debate regularly changes the minds of listeners, & sometimes even plants seeds in the mind of the debate opponent themselves--seeds which grow & flourish.

Blair Kamin accuses Trump of playing politics, then goes on to make the most one-sided, biased arguments possible.  His rant is not worthy of a publication like Chicago Tribune.

Reasonable people, who think through the arguments, so far have always seen what we are warning against. As long as they don't feel attacked, and can honestly consider the arguments, it works.

They seek to defund police, open borders, take away jobs and leadership based solely by skin color & gender, eliminate free speech, roll back due process, and much more.   They have not won the war yet. There is still much ground to defend.

All of 9 unarmed black men were killed by police last year (compared to 19 unarmed white men). That's Washington Post data.   Police killing of black Americans has declined almost 80% from the ’60s through the 2010s. (For reference, whites flatlined). CDC data.

You can't fix racism with racism.  You can, however, identify the specific examples of structural racism--being doubly careful to question whether your statistics include all relevant variables--and work against those directly.

Goal should be zero for brutality and violence and looting. However, a problem affecting millions, instead of just a few, is the representation of how widespread each of the three are.

I know pretty much any terminology that is felt to oppose their goals comes under attack by them. Examples include egalitarianism, free speech, equality, and many more.

That people might misinterpret your intention? I certainly wasn't. I know you aren't a race baiter nor an identitarian.   But you may not see (or agree?) that frequently highlighting racial correlation without causation creates division.

I worry deeply that more we highlight racial disparity where it's not a result of current racism, the more we create racial divide.  I envision a world where people are treated equally regardless of race.   I believe you and I share that vision.

Tweet 1: 0 mentions of poverty, 1 mention of race, "non-white". Tweet 2: 0 mentions of poverty, 2 mentions of race. 3: 2 hints at poverty, 4 mentions of race.  And this goes through the entire thread. It's my turn to ask:

How does that do anything other than fuel racial divide?

Reject bigotry across the board.   As soon as you start ranking groups of people, you stop factoring in individual circumstances, and become the very thing you are fighting against: judging people by their skin color.

Without that, construction workers have no incentive to build houses. If you'd like to go back to people building their own with the help of the community, then convince people. Good luck!

People actively scour for sentences that can be spun to sound bad, and ignore what the person actually said (and of course ignore anything they've said directly to the contrary).

(At least the liberal left, not the progressives). No topic should be off limits. If something is bad for good reason, then knowing the reasons is by far the best deterrent.

Best I can think of is that it exposes that he has different sexual partners. Or maybe that he expects to have more in the future? Or that you went home with a person who believed he'd go home with someone at some point?

Treat the accuser and the accused BOTH as if they are telling the truth, until a court of law can review the hard evidence and make a determination. Even then, without either hard evidence that the accusation is fabricated, treat them both as innocent.

We are all in this together, and we all deserve to be treated as innocent until proven guilty. That sucks when there's no hard evidence to convict someone who is truly guilty -- but that's worth the tradeoff to all know we will be presumed innocent.

He failed because he didn't pay speakers or staff for multiple events, but kept putting them on anyway. He took $500 per ticket and refused to refund after canceling the event.

That doesn't bode well for future events.

You have to wonder, at what point IS it acceptable to make people aware of the consistent failings of an organizer? I would argue that it's sometime before the organizer has created a wake of 1000s of people owed $500,000+, and all without doing much to make it right.

Since there's no public statement about what other people did, I'd be interested to hear it. I'm not biased against Travis as a person -- I wanted him to succeed. That's part of why this is all so unacceptable.

The "Pangburn response" doesn't add anything new that makes it OK that Travis didn't pay speakers, didn't pay staff & contractors, and left thousands of people out in the cold on hundreds of thousands of dollars in tickets.

What I do know is that he didn't pay dozens of speakers and employees, canceled events costing thousands of people thousands of dollars, and then tried to pretend like just closing the legal entity makes all of that ok.
