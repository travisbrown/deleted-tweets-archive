I do not blame the Capitol riot on Antifa. I blame it on Donald Trump & said so in the podcast two days after. This article is on the cyclical nature of violence- which we now see in LA  https://www.spiked-online.com/author/jeremy-lee-quinn/

California Antifa adherents, in a banner drop, posted names & home addresses of conservatives they suspect associated with Proud Boys, or they disagree with. Several flyers were posted in the vicinity of the 7/13 Los Angeles  #WiSpaProtest , publicly listing home addresses. pic.twitter.com/PcD0oqHEEj

It appears as of now- unless WiSpa says otherwise, this is a textbook example of false news / conspiracy rumor launched by way of either bias or bad faith on  @twitter . pic.twitter.com/7ecENEGRQH

The author at  @LosAngelesBlade  R.Lansing does not seem to understand WiSpaUSA is a walk-in public bath. Did he assume from the website, based on the existence of optional massages, that it was an appointment only facility?  https://www.wispausa.com/appointments/
* [11 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210711182528/https://twitter.com/UnblockedLive/status/1414289681877929985) ([live](https://twitter.com/UnblockedLive/status/1414287204004679681)): Fascinating. The False insinuation is spreading to  @Slate  & now  @TheAdvocateMag . Did you talk to PD  @e_urq  ?    There is another false claim in the  @LosAngelesBlade  story, that  #Wispa  is by appointment only. NO. Massage is. But walk-up entry for public bath use, not so.  Wow... pic.twitter.com/49rAz413mX

LAPD re.  @LosAngelesBlade  story spreading to  @Slate  &  @Independent  = Inaccurate PIO: "There was no reported crime for us to investigate to actually take a crime report." pic.twitter.com/a1N29sWxnH

If I am going to be critical of my own work-  "attempted to pepper spray" isn't enough. It is significant that they went to the bag & then all the way back to escalate the fight. I pressed this on the pod.
* [10 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210710104134/https://twitter.com/UnblockedLive/status/1413810568155131904): So now my turn:  1. At what point in your journalism training  @desertborder  did you decide your work should be praxis 'direct action', as opposed to empirical journalism critical of all sides in a conflict?  2. Will you release the video you shot of  @SocalAntifa  attacking 7/3?
* [10 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210710104134/https://twitter.com/UnblockedLive/status/1413810568155131904) ([live](https://twitter.com/UnblockedLive/status/1413809402318974976)): My guess is Jane followed that account inadvertently as she doesn't follow my main  @jleequinn . Lengthy response to a heckle! Whew. Why I treat you  @desertborder  with utmost professionalism I attribute to my training. I learned to keep my personal feelings out of my work.
* [10 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210710104134/https://twitter.com/UnblockedLive/status/1413810568155131904) ([live](https://twitter.com/UnblockedLive/status/1413808132111749129)): Naturally as a researcher I have several accounts (to deal with bad faith block & slander accounts aligned w  @SocalAntifa  for example). One of my accounts squatted the name /  http://publicreport.org  my research project tracing Anarcho-tactics on the left & right since May 2020...

All my on-air training I received from her. I headed off to West Virginia for my first job as an anchor/ reporter after the summer . Jane & I have been touch over the years off- on. When the  @nytopinion  article came out we were in contact-

See, I couldn't afford to go to UC Berkeley Grad J-school or anything like that. So back in 2003 I interned for  @JaneWells  & I remember her saying 'We got to get you writing.' I had only been writing comedy since my high school paper editor days...

I should disclose there were only three Trans people in Saturday’s  SoCal Antifa crowd that I saw.  There may have been a few more. In the other words, just like  #BLM ,  #wispaprotest  was about fanatical activist opportunism by moral authoritarians. pic.twitter.com/YvZrgYwEyS

As I always do, like a fly on the wall. As I said, you are invited to appear on my Livecast and challenge what I have documented. But as far as I can see, the only propagandist attempting to label / control truth is You.

Those who seek solutions- and those who exacerbate and exploit emotions. As the vast majority get off on their own self righteousness, productive voices are always muted compared to the outrage fiends & their rot.

Btw, if you scrutinize the alt-media promotion leading up to 1/6, are we surprised that infowars is connected? As the Capitol investigation expands, I'm gonna guess they are still looking closely at 2 very big names. https://twitter.com/ryanjreilly/status/1382120301765492740

Does one's actual intent matter ?    What do you think hers was in reposting the historical photo and the intent of the content itself ?   Thanks

 2. Fan who posted did so under a hashtag to fire  @GinaCarano . Disdain before, celebration after
