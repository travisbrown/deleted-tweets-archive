While this is considerable, if the evidence changes we’d change the recommendations. We’re not a priori wedded to it—it must comport with the best data

I’d highly recommend Cynical Theories by  @ConceptualJames  and  @HPluckrose    Most important book I’ve read in the last decade and directly answers your question

Perhaps not valuing education, disfellowshipping, a unique brainwashing, lowest common denominator moral “pandering,” etc. These are just speculations. I’m really not sure.

The principles are the same (identical, even), you’d just have to work out the details. Key is the asynchronous element. (E.g., there’d be no “room” for pauses and reflection.)

Things are in such flux now I’m not sure what will emerge. So, as unsatisfying as it may be, it’s tough to say at this point.

I just go with how they define it but make them adhere to it so as to avoid semantic dodges. (I wrote about this in my first book. I’ve developed it since.)

Before he died, Victor Stenger told me it’s a type of irrationality on the left. No question that’s true. The question is why. Why that one particular issue?  @ConceptualJames  has a great response to your question

It’s tempting to say they offer easy answers, but the real reason is likely because they’ve assumed power through force and dispense with their ideological enemies.

I don’t play cards, or haven’t since I was a child. I use to play gin and poker with my grandparents. My grandmother was really sick and my grandfather and I use to take care of her. We played a lot of cards

I’ve often pleaded with my colleagues to stop the mollycoddling madness because, if for no other reason, a real crisis will come along and then what? They won’t be positioned to handle it.
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316052608/https://twitter.com/peterboghossian/status/1239421855922077696): VU

* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316052336/https://twitter.com/peterboghossian/status/1239421560676474880): Yes. There’s lots of good content on this too, from sci fi to interesting ideas. I spent a weekend with Tim Leary and he laid out a fascinating idea of the intelligence behind DNA.

* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316053203/https://twitter.com/peterboghossian/status/1239420575770013696): This is a surprisingly difficult question, as these terms are increasingly murky/muddled and the semantic range of “liberal” has been stretched and means different things in different parts of the world, eg, the Liberal party in Australia or liberal in the UK
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316051826/https://twitter.com/peterboghossian/status/1239420184575655940): I’ve not listened to that, so I’m not sure what the focus has been. Check out  @HPluckrose ’s work on that. She’s excellent

* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316052343/https://twitter.com/peterboghossian/status/1239419622719250433): I like to follow the DMs lead. I think that makes for a more interesting adventure. Speaking of which, we just played via Skype for the first time! It went remarkably well

I think many of have realized that our system really is fragile and we need to be vigilant. Attacks from the far right and left have been undermining our democracy.

Shelly Kagan has also taken aim at that, as a compatabilist. Dennett too. One can understand the concepts without their being true.   I’m not sure this answers your question.
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316051648/https://twitter.com/peterboghossian/status/1239417873652527104): No. But I’m 53 and that was a long time ago

Everyone will look to their preexisting biases and confirm them.   I was thinking today, how many educators would re-evaluate the idea that the purpose of education is to promote Social Justice and remediate oppression? A: Not one
* [16 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200316050753/https://twitter.com/peterboghossian/status/1239417405907984385): I don’t put myself in the y’all category. As one point of contact, I’ve been repeatedly told I’m not a “real academic” and that I’m not “a real philosopher”.

Dictators (NKorea), rogue regimes, and hostile foreign powers have radically *discounted* prices on US goods, esp media (film, TV, music, etc.)

I’m also a fan of the Great Books classes/universities. That said, yes, expand the canon to include Asian, African, Native American thought—but it plays by the same rules and is subject to critique.

(That’s also why I don’t understand those who romanticize the past. Nobody experiencing serious dental pain romanticizes bygone ages.)
* [14 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200314210517/https://twitter.com/peterboghossian/status/1238926042544214016): I see what you did there.

I’m just not sure what will replace it and when. I suspect we’ll see third tier universities collapse within a year. We’re already experiencing what that looks like now.
* [14 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200314210736/https://twitter.com/peterboghossian/status/1238928583927582720): I’ve played two recently. A NE gnome illusionist who truly was NE and my current LN human Paladin who’s suffering from mental illness.

Only the top tier schools will make it. Too bad those who caused its collapse will not understand that that they were the architects of its demise.

Ask him what his goal is and work backward. If it’s to get a degree then he needs to be smart about asking questions. E.g., “what should I say if someone bring up this point...?”

Is it to get his degree? Many (most?) professors look at the university as an ideology mill. He needs to choose his professors wisely.

Educators can provide students with try skill set, but far more important is helping them value certain attitudinal dispositions, like being trustful of reason and being willing to revise their beliefs.

The higher the self-report on the scale, the more oriented toward morality the follow up questions should be.
* [14 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200314092027/https://twitter.com/peterboghossian/status/1238700540407635968): Great question. One problem in  talking with people whose thinking is damaged is that they want to damage your thinking. So no response can be a “message”. Rather, asking targeted Socratic-type questions to ask them if they agree with themselves.

Also, my pool is self-selected as those who want to be challenged tend to enroll in my classes. (As do some who don’t—by enrollment choice.)

The more we know about the people who’ll be killed, the easier the decision could be. If it’s pushing the fat man scenario, at some point I’d push him if the consequences were high enough

Close to zero. The moral claims? A few are on target re being rationally derivable, e.g., the way to treat others with kindness

I’d suggest two things: 1) go back to Plato and read that, 2) find a clear into of the history of intellectual thought. Simon Blackburn’s is quite good.
