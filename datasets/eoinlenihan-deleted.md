The apparent suicide of Andrew Dodson is one such consequence. https://newrepublic.com/article/150159/doxx-racist

* [24 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190525042826/https://twitter.com/eoinlenihan/status/1132000337110413312): Here, three of the most connected individuals in our Antifa dataset, Emily Gorcenski, Jason Wilson & Mark Bray collaborate to justify doxing, stalking, deplatforming & curtailing free expression. Normalising Antifa tactics in The Guardian. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/19/how-the-world-has-fought-back-against-the-violent-far-right-and-started-winning
* [21 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521103224/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1130768003023425536): ***Important***   Anyone who's been in chatrooms with ProgDAD will not be in any way exposed. This is not the purpose of academic research. I am working on developing interventions for young people in danger of being attracted to online extremism left & right. No judgements.
* [21 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521103224/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1130768003023425536): At any rate. Please contact me with any more accusations being made by these reporter's defenders in the Antifa press and I will be happy to start publishing DMs to support what I have said. Thanks.
* [21 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521103224/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1130768003023425536): It is apparent from my discussions in the DMs with Hayden and from the Antifa mob that have been harassing me for a week, that they do not believe in redemption for extremists. I believe they are pursuing an economic & partisan model, not one that is for the social good.
* [21 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521103224/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1130768003023425536): My belief is that these people are annoyed because of my Antifa thread (I study left and right and have questions about journalists and extremism experts who only study one) and because I believe in the concept of research for developing interventions - i.e. redemption.
* [21 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521103224/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1130768003023425536): Hayden (and to a degree O'Brien of the HuffPo) was made aware of this ongoing research a year ago.
* [21 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521103224/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1130768003023425536): ProgDad granted access to people who would not normally be available to researchers for qualitative research purposes. I was fortunate to get 10 long form interviews with individuals from "far right" chatrooms - all done ethically and openly. pic.twitter.com/a1nC02wd5C
* [21 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521103224/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1130768003023425536): Hayden confirmed that he remembered this exchange three days ago. All caps of that interaction ready to post if there is any dispute.
* [21 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521103224/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1130768003023425536): More than a year ago ProgDad had contact with Michael Hayden about ProgDad. In that DM exchange he told Hayden that ProgDad was a vehicle for research into the FarRight and told him about that research plan. Hayden said he thought ProgDad was funny.
* [21 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521103224/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1130768003023425536): And the praise goes on. Here's the significant thing.
* [21 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521103224/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1130768003023425536): https://pjmedia.com/trending/progressive-dad-best-troll-internet-right-now/  Here's a write up from  @PJMedia_com  calling him the "best troll on the internet".
* [21 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521103224/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1130768003023425536): I can't see the claims being made but here is some praise for ProgDad. The first is from liberal and fan  @joerogan  who calls ProgDad hilarious. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiL5EUWjtWg
* [21 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521103224/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1130768003023425536): I've been too overwhelmed with responses to get around to them all. Thanks for bringing this to my attention. This individual has been trying to poke holes in the work for a couple of days. When he couldn't dispute the method anymore he went this route and now looks foolish.
* [21 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521103224/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1130768003023425536): Well that's awkward for Mr Kavanagh who's been pursuing an agenda the past couple of days. I turned down the opportunity to speak on InfoWars for exactly this reason. Our work is non-partisan.
* [21 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521103224/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1130768003023425536): I can't see the stories being spread because I'm blocked by the "news outlet" that is spreading the story. I do know that they are on our list of highly connected Antifa accounts and they were extremely annoyed that I mentioned the Unicorn Riot to Chris Mathias pipeline.
* [21 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521103224/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1130768003023425536): Good morning. Apparently some Antifa news sources are trying to discredit our work by stating that I ran a political satire account. My analysis of ProgDadTV is that it poked fun at SM outrage culture and it's many viral tweets shows mastery of the media. A short thread.
* [20 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521095353/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1129747531964059655): Agree. A journalist may follow people for many reasons. But when you’re in the top 2% of highly connected Antifa accounts if you are not producing articles critical of Antifa or a balanced output, it raises questions about if it’s for research purposes.
* [19 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521095715/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128731412180426752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw): A major question then is, is AntifFashGordon, one of the best known Antifa doxers on Twitter a reliable source? His definitions of fascism are intentionally skewed and he affords no room for redemption. Why are "national-level" journalists using him as a source?
* [19 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521095715/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128731412180426752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw): The biggest issue with AntiFashGordon and with Antifa doxers in general is that they do not believe in redemption. Here Gordon chases continues to harass a target from town to town, job to job. How does this end? pic.twitter.com/lH83eEPkgU
* [19 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521095715/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128731412180426752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw): Here's a major issue with AntiFashGordon. In a recent interaction Gordon insinuated that  @BretWeinstein , a progressive Jewish man, and  @RubinReport  are a fascists. This is an issue when individuals supplying doxes to reporters pursue political vendettas. pic.twitter.com/CK36cX99sG
* [19 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521095715/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128731412180426752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw): The tweet was publicly available on a TL, sent to me and I asked for authentication.
* [19 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521095715/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128731412180426752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw): AntiFashGordon is an Antifa account dedicated to doxing. In this DM he talks about passing "dossiers" of doxes to journalists. He indicates that he has more than one national-level journalist he works with. I asked him to confirm the authenticity of the DM. He declined. pic.twitter.com/F5EEzkg9Wb
* [19 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190519195418/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1130198436605767680): Unsurprisingly, I’ve had masses trying to get me removed from my work since it went up. Some of them are journalists on that list with grudges. More on that soon.
* [18 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521095353/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1129747531964059655): Coverage of our findings about working relationships between Antifa and verified Twitter journalists via  @RedState  https://www.redstate.com/brandon_morse/2019/05/17/journos-prominent-news-publications-found-working-relationships-antifa/
* [17 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521100659/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128752041327759360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw): *Important - he was cleared of any wrong doing but he was not allowed back to work. Thanks everyone who clarified.
* [17 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190520001857/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128753979205271558?conversation_id=1128729619417505792): Mathias is the most connected journalist in the entire dataset. He has an incredible 14 degree range of connections within the dataset. That means he is in the top 0.15% of Antifa and Antifa associated accounts. pic.twitter.com/Go2Zjks9r9
* [16 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521100659/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128752041327759360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw): Which is fair. No room for racists. My point is about the dangers of Antifa-led journalism.
* [16 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190518093233/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128763034942484484): That is my opinion also. I'm working on a project related to that too. The social, emotional and economic impact of being doxed by Antifa. Most were not what could be considered far right. Will post a thread on that soon.
* [16 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190518093233/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128763034942484484): The vitriol kind of works in favour of what I'm saying I think.
* [16 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190518015443/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128784592763260929?conversation_id=1128784592763260929): It isn't. Everyone opposes fascism except fascists. I oppose organised extremist groups like Antifa who operate outside the confines of the law. Extremism is extremism.
* [16 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190520002236/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128738648684470272?conversation_id=1128729619417505792): It's very simple. How many innocent of all charges individuals are on the website with all their personal info listed?
* [16 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190520002236/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128738648684470272?conversation_id=1128729619417505792): Not an answer.
* [16 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190520002236/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128738648684470272?conversation_id=1128729619417505792): The numbers are yours. Right here it states 292 people were guilty and 262 were not guilty or had cases dismissed (near 50%). If that's not the case I suggest you amend the website. pic.twitter.com/3iZsWvT0Qk
* [16 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521100659/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128752041327759360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw): What's with the digs about moving to Stuttgart, reporting me to the state and being protected? You understand how one might interpret that as threatening? Also, here's the updated story where he (a terrible person) was cleared of any wrongdoing https://www.wsls.com/news/virginia/southside/patrick-county-emt-who-made-racist-remarks-cleared-by-department-of-health
* [16 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190521100659/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128752041327759360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw): Guy is a horrible & racist man. I have no sympathy for him losing his job over his comments. I have issue with journalists working with Antifa to dox and harass people on a national level. It's unethical and dangerous. As last tweets in thread point out - they get it wrong too.
* [16 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190520002236/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128738648684470272?conversation_id=1128729619417505792): 1. Ok. Not guilty or cases dismissed then. The site still exists to amplify the personal info of people you feel are fascist (though legally aren't).  2. I am only quoting (caps supplied) your data.  3. Not according to your own data.  4. Irrelevant. 5. Safe move.
* [15 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190518015443/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128784592763260929?conversation_id=1128784592763260929): https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128729619417505792  A long thread on the troubling relationship between Antifa and verified journalists on Twitter.
* [15 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190516082107/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128729619417505792): Notice how the eager doxer states that "we got a major publication on his ass" after clearly stating the person they doxed isn't a Nazi. I can't confirm which HuffPo writer incentivised Nazi hunting but there's at least one whose bylines are all extended doxes.
* [15 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190516082107/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128729619417505792): A  @HuffPo  writer incentivised Antifascist doxers to provide him with the doxes of Nazis. The doxer admitting here in DMs provided by a member of the group, clerly states they had no Nazis so people they had a grudge against will do.
* [15 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190516082107/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128729619417505792): Here the doxer who claimed he has an  @HuffPost  journalist on call admits that the individual they are doxing is not a white supremacist or fascist but they'll give it to the HuffPo writer because it have been incentivised. pic.twitter.com/5dC4Ogmjis
* [15 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190516082107/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128729619417505792): Mathias is not alone in mining Antifa for doxes of individuals be they fascist or not. Policy at HuffPo (Luke O'Brien) seems to be to create a constant Nazi scare to fill headlines. I spoke to two defectors from a doxing collective who said a HuffPo writer offered cash for doxes. pic.twitter.com/dERzJegNij
* [15 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190516082107/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128729619417505792): In the case of Identity Europa, many are despicable people and they have been labeled an extremist group by the  @splcenter  but again, among out top 2% is chief investigative reporter for the SPLC Matthew Hayden who's connections within Antifa are problematic. pic.twitter.com/sO0tjqcu8Y
* [15 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190516082107/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128729619417505792): I dislike white supremacists & fascists. There is no place for them in society. The problem with Matthias' approach is that apart from having a poor conviction rate against the people he doxes, he's relying on doxes & info from people who's definition of fascist is questionable.
* [15 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190516082107/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128729619417505792): What happens here is that Mathias harvests info from his Antifa network to cast serious allegations against individuals with potentially career shattering consequences and, through doxing, opens up the real chance of violence and serious harm against them...
* [15 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190516082107/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128729619417505792): Here he uses HuffPo to out a "Prominent white supremacist" & was instrumental (along with his Antifa network) in getting him investigated. It later turned out the man was cleared of any wrong doing & allowed back to work. Like the Europa case Mathias doxes first, facts later. pic.twitter.com/omDrJARr1p
* [15 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190516082107/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128729619417505792): Antifascist news outlet  @UR_Ninja  leaked discord servers from an Identity Europa server in April and Mathias, took them from there. It's a common theme. Mattias lets Antifa doxers do the heavy work, he does the national level doxing. Nate Thayer, another fav of his. pic.twitter.com/XEu5aF9nH4
* [15 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190516082107/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128729619417505792): At the time of writing he had no idea of their innocence or guilt and as of his pinned tweet, the matter is still only under investigation. How he came to dox these individuals before they were afforded any due process is interesting...
* [15 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190516082107/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128729619417505792): Christopher Mathias is a senior writer at  @HuffPost  who specialises in the Far Right. In a recent piece he wrote about members of Identity Europa he spread the doxes of several alleged members serving in the military. pic.twitter.com/s5LY4Dxucd
* [15 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190516082107/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128729619417505792): Mark Bray - also in the top 2% of our dataset - & author of Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook (he donated 50% of profits to the Antifa International Defence Fund) is a recurring Wilson source in his columns. Together they downplay Antifa violence & extremism in The Guardian. pic.twitter.com/nhLLWzIiPW

In a recent piece in which he reports on an intelligence report by the ROCIC which states that Antifa are responsible for street violence just as the far right are, he heavily relies on Mark Bray as a primary source to attack the report. pic.twitter.com/yWe6dxoT1X
* [15 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190516082107/https://twitter.com/EoinLenihan/status/1128729619417505792): The point here being that those verified accounts that remain in the dataset at a degree range of 8+ are highly connected and in most cases closely associated with or self-identifying members of Antifa. So...on to the apparent ties between  @HuffPost  and  @guardian  to Antifa.

Further she created the "First Vigil" website that processes court documents to share the personal information of suspected members of the far right. In cases where people are found innocent (50%), info is still shared. pic.twitter.com/vLBUi1SiMl

These were the 1.65% most connected Antifa and Antifa associated accounts on Twitter. Each had a minimum of 8 connections within the initial dataset, most having many more.

Try not to dox, dog-pile, harass, defame, organize real life violence against or get regular Joe’s you happen to disagree with fired while I’m asleep. Thanks. 😴

Not only are they capable of extreme violence, but they are a terrific recruiter for the far right. Important to reject vigilantism at every turn - need a demand for sanity from the centre.

Stable democracies have security forces who are trained & authorised to deal with any extremist groups. Those who pursue vigilantism are a threat to individuals & the state. That includes Antifa. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/01/intelligence-law-enforcement-report-leftwing-terrorists-charlottesville
