Had our second child, tried to be good goys: work, home, parenthood, etc. Classic grist for the ZOG mill.

MS-13 tattoos appeared in grocery stores just as both parties conspired to amnesty illegal invaders. Buchanan & Steyn began to appeal!

Place was chockablock w/ wealthy Jews & gays. Living Animal House lifestyle while maintaining GPA to keep academic scholarship were the priorities. Debauchery, fun!

Thought it was cool to practice Spanish with them. They drove drunk, littered, bought us beer, sent half their money back to their real home, but they were ‚Äúnice guys.‚Äù

Bought the black victimization narrative hook, line, and sinker. No Hispanics. Only knew one Jew, a mischling, and she seemed friendly and normal enough. It was a nice place to grow up.
