* [12 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210912162612/https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1437090034344251398): By the way, the terms "grifter" and "contrarian" have the same exactly functional definition of "white supremacist": one who opposes the Democratic Party.
* [12 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210912162612/https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1437090034344251398) ([live](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1437088697090969605)): In case anyone thinks that the functional definition of "white supremacy" I laid above is hyperbolic or otherwise exaggerated: https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/22/politics/biden-charlamagne-tha-god-you-aint-black/index.html
* [12 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210912162612/https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1437090034344251398) ([live](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1437088149344333831)): Someone please explain how it is - under the decreed rules of liberal discourse - that these particular journalists possess the moral credibility to explicitly accuse Larry Elder of being a "white supremacist"?    The operational definition of that term: one who opposes Democrats  https://twitter.com/tomselliott/status/1437076813235343371
* [ 7 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210907201826/https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1435336612012072967): The easiest thing to do would be to scream that Bolsonaro is a genocidal dictator who is preparing to perpetrate a coup. If I wanted to do that, I could do it in a tweet.
* [ 7 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210907201826/https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1435336612012072967) ([live](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1435332380844244997)): The tumultuous events in Brazil today are highly consequential but also complex. Avoid reductive narratives from either the Brazilian or international press. The context to all this is vital. Some journalists are providing it.  I'll have a report up tonight once the day unfolds.
* [ 7 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210907201826/https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1435336612012072967) ([live](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1435331989888978955)): After implicitly threatening the Brazilian Supreme Court earlier today in Brasilia, Bolsonaro flew to S√£o Paulo and vowed to his supporters to disobey orders from one particular judge.  He repeated his line: my only options are prison, death or victory- and I'm not going to jail.
* [ 7 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210907201826/https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1435336612012072967) ([live](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1435271095502917637)): (Just a correction: Miller was detained at the airport this morning when trying to leave from Brasilia back to the US, not when he arrived in Brazil).
* [ 7 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210907201826/https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1435336612012072967) ([live](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1435268051977506816)): Tensions rising: a mainstream Brazilian outlet,  @Metropoles , reports the Federal Police detained Trump's long-time adviser Jason Miller when he arrived in Brasilia today, on orders of the Supreme Court, questioned about plotting anti-democratic acts: https://twitter.com/igorgadelham/status/1435252188486455296
* [ 7 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210907201826/https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1435336612012072967) ([live](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1435267327055089668)): Brazil's center-right, neoliberal party that had long been PT's adversary (lost 4 straight elections to them), then was replaced by Bolsonaro on the right, says they're convening an emergency meeting about impeachment given Bolsonaro's threat to the Court https://twitter.com/PSDBoficial/status/1435258168708325377
* [ 7 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210907201826/https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1435336612012072967) ([live](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1435263493431861259)): "Either the head of [the Brazilian Supreme Court] limits the power [of this judge] or it will suffer what we don't want" --  Brazil's President  @JairBolsonaro , speaking today to supporters in Brasilia and issuing what is clearly a threat based on this judge's perceived abuses.
* [ 7 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210907201826/https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1435336612012072967) ([live](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1435234620002480130)): Protesting is a right everyone has. Hopefully, today will be largely peaceful and the increasingly vitriolic political conflicts in Brazil will be resolved the way they should be: through the 2022 election. But Brazil's democracy is only 35 years old, so it's all precarious.
* [ 7 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210907201826/https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1435336612012072967) ([live](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1435234278040821761)): One odd backdrop to all this: over the last 2 years, a Supreme Court justice has been ordering pro-Bolsonaro bloggers, activists, and politicians imprisoned or kicked off the internet, fueling much rage. Some were clearly plotting coups but other cases raised censorship concerns.
* [ 7 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210907201826/https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1435336612012072967) ([live](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1435233893179867141)): There are, as I've always said, many big differences between Trump & Bolsonaro, the most important being how much older and more stable are US democratic institutions. But pro-democracy centers have been very resilient and defiant against Bolsonaro: stronger than many thought.
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902223513/https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1433550155194769411): Come√ßando agora: https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1433519871342653442

* [25 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210825070531/https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1430351589089370115) ([live](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1430336441155006464)): The Bizarre Refusal to Apply Cost-Benefit Analysis to COVID Debates https://rumble.com/vln3ca-the-bizarre-refusal-to-apply-cost-benefit-analysis-to-covid-debates.html
* [12 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210812234050/https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1425965490648797191): pic.twitter.com/9eHyUsxdxt

That's always been the right's justification for authoritarianism and still is: we'll keep you safe from crime, disorder, instability, violence. From Hungary to Singapore to Cuba to Saudi Arabia, that's the justification they use. But now: from the left!
* [10 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210810135743/https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1425088272766750721): Yes, imagine.ü§£ü§£ pic.twitter.com/ojqzrXZ7fI

A small but illustrative case study: https://twitter.com/DrewHolden360/status/1424877535184175108
* [ 1 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210801144934/https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1421845422604177409): That's why I don't try to tell people in poor & working-class communities what their policing needs and policies are. I leave it to them to decide, precisely because I know that it's easy for someone with resources to say "defend the police" because they'll have private security. pic.twitter.com/ynDWeFi4hR

* [ 1 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210801144934/https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1421845422604177409) ([live](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1421822035295150083)): That's why I keep returning to this episode:  1) The Squad will not use its power to impede Pelosi even when she's acting against their claimed beliefs;  2) AOC, Bowman & Tlaib spent a year chanting DEFUND THE POLICE but then ensured more funding for the Police that protect them.
* [ 1 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210801144934/https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1421845422604177409) ([live](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1421821729031208964)): Look at what the Squad did there. All 6 members were going to defy Pelosi and vote NO on more spending for Capitol Police -- but only when they thought it would pass without them. Once they realized that would sink Pelosi's bill, they backed away. The dissent is only for theater.
* [ 1 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210801144934/https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1421845422604177409) ([live](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1421821200251170816)): That's why the Squad's behavior on Pelosi's bill to increase Capitol Police funding is vital. All 6 of them agreed to join the GOP and vote NO, but when they realized that would sink the bill, AOC, Tlaib & Bowman voted "present" so it passed by 1 vote: https://greenwald.substack.com/p/the-squad-enables-pelosis-massive
* [ 1 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210801144934/https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1421845422604177409) ([live](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1421820769508679683)): Vintage Squad politics: Lots of performative theatrical dissidence, sometimes well-motivated. But ultimately, it's always boxed in by a refusal to wield real power if doing so means defying Pelosi or subverting the Dem Party. It keeps pseudo-edgy leftists loyal to the Party. https://twitter.com/MaxBlumenthal/status/1421668812659830786
* [30 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210730184324/https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1421179610641928194): Can you even imagine what goes in those meetings?

I found what she said astounding:   https://twitter.com/ktbenner/status/1420165664493522948  pic.twitter.com/rG3Aej3WGm

Indeed, the only unanswered question answered about January 6 -- how embedded was FBI in the groups that planned it? -- is notably off the table.

That's what today is for.   But the fixation on 1/6 is about exactly this: classifying Trump supporters as Enemies of the State for political gain & Security State power.
* [27 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210728012329/https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1420193060722458628) ([live](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1420053123079475202)): Absolutely amazing: the New York Times' Justice Department reporter says the US faces an "essential natsec dilemma": namely, that Trump supporters are "enemies of the state" and all of the GOP is a threat to the State. This is a reporter -- not an op-ed writer -- saying this:  https://twitter.com/ktbenner/status/1420037852746878981

I did one of the most consequential investigative expos√©s on the planet there in 2019-2020. I produced more traffic by far than anyone until the year I quit. I said you *could* collect a huge salary for writing little if you want - and many do. I didn't.

They failed every step in trying to destroy him. Instead, he thrives.  That has to hurt, right,  @JohnBrennan ,  @brhodes ,  @GenMhayden , James Clapper?

This is so important to understand about how US media report on foreign countries.  For repressive US allies like Jordan, they *justify* rounding up regime opponents as necessary.
