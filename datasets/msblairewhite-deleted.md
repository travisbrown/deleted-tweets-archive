The reaction to my work is positive, with the like to dislike ratio rarely dipping under 99%.  I'm also clearly talking about a specific type of person who blames their issues on their identity, which I don't. So I don't see your point.

His 2nd most recent video has the word "masturbator" in it, and his 3rd most recent video has a thumbnail with an incredibly realistic looking dildo.  Not a fuckin' shocker he's getting demonetized.

When I was getting demonitized, I chose to diversify my income which is why I'm still thriving.  My point is LGBT content is not "discriminated against". Sex toy reviews don't get monetized.

I make LGBT content and I'm usually never demonetized.   Bria & Chrissy and Chase Ross make almost exclusively hyper sexual vids and sex toy reviews. Queer Kid Stuff is filth. I don't see why this is "discrimination" that Toyota doesn't place ads on that.
