The "authorities" seeking to do this ought to be made to pay a very high price for it.

* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826192251/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298702223900200960): The lesson of the Kyle Rittenhouse arrest is simple: fight Antifa/BLM and their white collar allies from the shadows. Plan, act, disappear . . . and keep your mouth shut.
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826191632/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298700752798404608): He's nothing but a big blowhard. If I had his power, this Bolshevik revolution shit would have been over before it got started good.
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826191301/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298699844802945024): Once they're stranded, it opens up all sorts of possibilities . . .

* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826190635/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298697970712342529): There's more going on on our side than meets the eye.
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826190635/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298697970712342529): I think it's already here. It's just ramping up, day by day.
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826190432/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298697440434954240): BLM/Antifa get bused in to places like Kenosha. It would be a shame if someone found out where those buses were parked and, say, set them all on fire, thus stranding the rioters. A crying shame, I tell you!
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826190049/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298696668125175813): They had better be careful what they wish for.
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826185905/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298696336540233728): You got that right! This is a fight to the finish.
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826185824/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298696143744860160): Sorry, I see I should have said "Ma'am" instead of "Sir."
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826185616/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298695655284543488): Very creative thinking, Sir.

* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826155731/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298650622284017665): Keep it simple, always. Only the essentials for the job at hand. All else is just useless baggage to weigh you down.
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826155549/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298649824212815872): Not all of us, Sir.
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826155152/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298649118521212930): We're here, skilled, experienced, and ready.
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826154521/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298647657242488832): That's why jews hate White Alpha males. There are lots out here. Take comfort in that, Sunshine.
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826154118/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298646483772686336): It is how we must fight in this present anti-White political climate.
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826153309/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298644342458871808): Very true, Sir. In my own experiences, woman have served invaluably in certain areas, including intel gathering.
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826030439/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298456108508442624): In 4Gen warfare, there is only a faint line, if any, separating the enemy's open combat assets (BLM/Antifa) from his supporting assets, such as media, business, academia, politicians, etc. In other words, it provides a target-rich environment. There are no innocent enemy assets.
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826025900/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298454676329832448): I believe there is evidence that the great flood of Noah's day was localized in the Tarim Basin in what is now western China. So the pyramids wouldn't have been involved. This flood occurred around 2300 BC. There are several great concurrent civilizations that were unaffected.
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826024449/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298451064354516992): Yes, I think you're right.
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826024043/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298450135387484160): Thank you, Katie!

* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826023806/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298449539708248065): and their value to your enemy. Make a plan for dealing with those assets. Share and carry out plan only with a small group (three or four) of highly-trusted compatriots. Keep your mouth shut. No bragging anywhere.
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826023806/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298449539708248065): There are certain things not said on the internet, of course. As this race war continues to unfold, learn your AO (Area of Operations) inside and out. Know the location of all vital assets, both friend and foe. Rank those unfriendly assets in order of their danger to you . . .
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826023236/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298448199179329536): That's the attitude they fear most.
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826021517/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298443723764690944): You nailed it!
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826021048/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298442638480220160): Agreed Sir. And deservedly so on all accounts.
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826020700/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298441612935090177): Loaded with #4 buck.
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826015648/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298438938609082368): You come into a place where my woman and I are eating and pull that "you better show support for BLM" shit, and I will beat the living fuck out of you. You have been warned.
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826014414/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298436006950051840): This has been the GOP's stance since the beginning, since the days of Lincoln. They see America as a "proposition nation," not one based on blood and soil for a transplanted  northern European population.
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826012653/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298431515853049858): Many vets, all the way from Rhodesia, Vietnam, Ireland, and the Balkans to Charlottesville. We are ready!
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826012051/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298430120319946752): The strength of a race is determined by its level of "racism." The higher that level, the healthier the race. The lower, the sicker and less healthy the race becomes. This is a fact of nature. Anti-racism in an unnatural social construct used against the White race.
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826011919/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298429482076954624): Agreed, Sir. I fought in the battles 20 years ago to keep that original flag, including a speech on the steps of the state capitol. I hate to see it given up so cravenly by the Mississippi GOP. Gutless cowards.
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826010507/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298426065665298433): Thank you, Sir.

* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826003805/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298419288026611712): It's already here. We are now witnessing the first battles as it escalates. We all need to keep our eyes open and know when and where to move into action in defense of our lives, property, and civilization.
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826002050/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298414938822770688): Dyin' ain't much of a livin'.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825235952/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298409593412956162): I had tenure. But my colleagues were not happy. But there was nothing they could do!
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825235919/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298409396393959424): Thank you, Ma'am. I reckon so.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825235541/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298408586025078785): In BLM/Antifa, you are seeing the natural results of the Western Allies' "victory" over Germany in 1945. Judeo-Communism won that war and has spread its poison throughout the entire civilization of the White man. The US needs to make amends for this great mistake. Juden raus!
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825234628/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298406140452253702): Hell yeah, I can pick mine up and carry her around. No problem.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825234433/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298405774599888896): This is what Communism looks like, Sir. These are Commies, not fascists. Fascists fought against Communist domination of Europe and the West last century.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825233400/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298403001766420480): That a secret cabal of rich men--largely Jews or representing Jew interests--took over the US banking and monetary system and use it for private gain and power.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825233221/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298402548362117127): I'll be back through from time to time. Make sure you got me some good chewing tobacco. I plan on seeing lots of dead Redlegs who'll need spittin' on.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825232815/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298401748407717888): That's it, Sir.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825232736/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298401604576706562): I recommend people read "The Creature from Jekyll Island" by G. Edward Griffin. My university American history students read it and got a new perspective on things.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825211646/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298368420589834242): I reckon so, too, Granny. Good day to you now, ma'am.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825211244/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298367618643091458): And the next Josey Wales, too, Granny.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825210309/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298365223456387073): Jews were at the center of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and stood to lose fortunes if the Abolitionists succeeded.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825210156/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298364910502641666): Oh yes . . . they certainly are.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825205424/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298362776012947456): The New John Brown is out there, waiting. So is the New Nat Turner. You better wake up, White Man. You're the target.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825205304/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298362525239726083): The New John Brown is out there, waiting . . .
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825205152/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298362355785621509): It is too easy for Whites to retreat to the sanctuary that money, location, and the rule of law can still provide. They don't want to see what's coming. They want to cook out and have a regular life. That time is ending. The enemy is at the gates. They must awaken or perish.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825201841/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298353897602416642): Nice birds!
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825201730/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298353743193411584): Tuesday music break: Vintage '70s look and attire! This is an amazingly good and soulful live vocal performance. That music was good way back then. I was there, and young. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev8SibkJhNg
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825194905/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298345312919183362): They need a good ass whippin', just like unruly children who misbehave.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825174355/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298315046553038857): We Southerners have always known they were savages that must be tightly controlled, for their own good and ours. Left to themselves, they can do nothing but consume and destroy. This is why we resisted, and still resist, the idea of equality and "civil rights." Disastrous!
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825173724/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298313450679152640): Wisconsin should have never sent troops to invade my Southern homeland in 1861. Had they not helped defeat us, it is likely that Kenosha and the entire state would be much better off. Had the South won, it is likely that the White man would be unchallenged today.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825171544/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298307880832110593): Just another day in da hood (or the tribal village) . . .
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825171242/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298307103082389504): It will be brutal & bloody, as most true civil wars are, especially those based on race & ideology. Regarding the US military, I think it will split on racial & rank lines. For Whites, the higher ranks go with the left. That's how they've been programmed. Most of the rest w/ us.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825030321/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298092207811883008): Fuck yeah!

* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825024939/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298090057295777792): My father, a WWII and Korean War vet, told me about Gen. Patton when I was about 12 years old. Made a lasting impression on me. I knew also that we fought the wrong enemy in WWII, and we're paying the price for it right now.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825024626/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298088640774430721): They have been brainwashed to hate themselves and their own people and civilization. It's sad.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825022049/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis17/status/1298082799199518720): Actually, Sir, none of them.

It will be White v. non-White and White race traitors; rural v. urban; nationalist v. Communist internationalist; among other factors. In fact, this war has already begun.

It is an in-group trait that is dangerous to us when applied to non-White outsiders. They see it as a sign of weakness, which it largely has now become.

The hard left (Communists) understands this. The Hard Right (not the Alt-Right) also understands it. At present, the hard left is fighting it out in the streets of leftist cities with the cops. This is not our fight, yet.
