If you observe that this is a recipe for chaos and instability, you‚Äôre missing the point. Those things *help* the ruling liberal class. This is exactly how it wants its authority expressed.
* [24 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200624061820/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275674152914083842): Yes, it must be that hate crimes are skyrocketing, not that people are being trained, influenced, and bullied to see more and more hate criminality day after day. ü§° https://twitter.com/KamzyGunaratnam/status/1275673608157880330

We told you so. F#ck you,  @johncardillo . https://twitter.com/johncardillo/status/1275432503055200263

* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623151018/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275433744325840903): No worries.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623143927/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275433039036809216): I‚Äôm happy to disagree. You‚Äôre happy to as well, but only if you ascribe it to my stupidity, incomprehension, weak English, and now apparently my bloodlust. Not ideal.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623143927/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275433039036809216): You keep saying so but can‚Äôt actually highlight an example of my incomprehension.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623143805/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275432187865772033): Declaratory again, and wrong. I‚Äôve read and responded directly to each of your points. My English is obviously fine, but nice try.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623144256/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275431488671158273): I‚Äôm good. You‚Äôre just declaratory. Very little substantial argument, no attempt to highlight what it is that‚Äôs not cohesive. Oh well.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623145514/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275430625688911874): It‚Äôs a more-than-fair inference. Unless I‚Äôm extraordinarily unreasonable, why wouldn‚Äôt you behave the same way towards others with whom you disagree?
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623140441/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275424345956012032): Dialogue between people who aren‚Äôt on the same page is pointless? Seems extreme. Not promising if this is going to be society‚Äôs course.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623140441/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275424345956012032): I didn‚Äôt deny the human aspect or defend it. I was highlighting the fact that it was apparently in the manual, to be applied situationally to suspects regardless of race. You‚Äôre assuming lack of humanity whenever I fail to express explicit compassion in a 280-character tweet.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623133728/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275417829228101637): What you said amounted to that. You were calling me "stupid" from the start--you seem very determined to ascribe any difference in viewpoint to my supposed ignorance, close-mindedness, poor English, etc. Maybe self reflect.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623140825/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275414782313672707): "You don't share my declaratory viewpoint, therefore you are ignorant." Strong stuff.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623130254/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275413446918574082): I was hoping you wouldn't notice my language difficulties. Be gentle with me. You are obviously much smarter than I and have a far stronger command over the English language.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623130114/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275411364232794112): "Systemic racism" explains nothing and obscures everything. The best studies and statistical evidence I've seen suggests that, yes, they are policed in proportion to their behavior. Knee-to-neck is apparently in the police manual and it's not applied on a racial basis.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623124719/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275410104997875715): @MiraSebastian @_as_97_ @jayper86251851 @BritishAlba @roberthalshaw02 @JayRodriguez9 You're mixing up different issues. Systemic racism is an empty concept, blacks are actually quite privileged, comparatively, and they are policed in proportion to their behavior. But I sympathize with their desire to live in a society that reflects them and their identity.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623125358/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275409302640082946): I voted for him. Didn't do much for me, and did nothing at all to fulfill his central campaign promises. Largely the opposite.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623125551/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275409126999371778): Ah, yes, because anyone with an anti-Trump take must be a liberal soy boy. You must have bought your comebacks off the shelf in 2016. It turns out he is just that shitty of a candidate. Sorry.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623124321/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275408545429827585): The protestors are out there for a lot of different reasons, and they are certainly influenced by the global media as well. I don't poll the populace before I adopt my views. I guess you're different in that way.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623125038/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275405175994437633): Lame af.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623123613/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275405097477046273): I just chatted with one of them the other day. He lives in New York and the whole thing gave him a nervous breakdown. He thinks it's way, way exaggerated, and he's very upset that all of the COVID-19 measures were suddenly completely ignored.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623123756/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275403691936428039): If you say so. The message seems confusing to me. Trump declared himself a law and order president, but law and order are obviously breaking down and he's unable to stop it. Biden wrote a strict sentencing law that Trump undid. Not inspiring, even if Biden is an opportunist.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623121759/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275400358764982275): BLM went global because the global media and capitalism push it, because it is not a threat to the establishment and actually arose from it. I have black friends and I live in Norway.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623121759/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275400358764982275): The notion that blacks are being persecuted because of their skin color is exaggerated at best. I champion Palestinians to the extent that I am struck by their unfair and brutal treatment, and I oppose Zionism.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623115827/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275396617244467200): Palestinians are being genocided. Blacks are not.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623120359/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275395703922143234): It's the Palestinian flag. No, I am not of Arab descent.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623115708/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275395243819614209): If you say so.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623115425/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275394956287508480): I doubt such privileges existed in the same way for whites, but again, I am not challenging them--I am fine with affirmative action. What I am failing to see is this oppressive system that forces blacks to resort to crime to survive, is all.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623115914/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275392851862532101): Then is Trump the one who emptied the prisons? ü§î
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623115028/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275392253800873984): I guess  @rossNOIRElloyd  is proving the existence of "systemic racism" from behind a block. Disappointed I can't see it. pic.twitter.com/ONfyiZFQXx
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623113652/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275391267841675265): I'm not attacking their privileges. I'm just observing that they exist for them in ways that they don't for other groups, whatever the rationale is. I have been invited to look at it "from the other point of view" all my life. That's the message schools and media broadcast.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623112454/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275388361063247872): If "systemic racism" is common knowledge then it should be easy to establish with reasoning and evidence. You don't have to foam and curse to get me to read an article, but I doubt it's going to explain how this hangover tax arrangement substantiates "systemic racism."
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623112319/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275386083577036800): There were still white British slave owners in 2015? Maybe clarify, and try to come up with some more comprehensive documentation than some post you saw on Instagram.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623111237/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275384462227001348): For example, I spent a lot of time in higher education, and in those settings blacks seemed to have a lot of set-asides and special treatment carved out for them. Across all media and institutional life their views and demands are given special attention. Seems privileged to me.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623110701/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275383998202683397): I am saying that "systemic racism" is a wild claim with no evidence. You might be so high on your own supply that you do not even sense the need to substantiate your own beliefs and prejudices.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623110418/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275383091356471296): I fail to see evidence of this allegedly systematic disadvantage under which blacks are placed, such that they are in a dramatically worse condition than other racial groups. In some way they enjoy more privilege that other groups. The notion of their oppression is exaggerated.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623105756/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275382458024955904): My argument is pretty intelligible. Systemic racism is an empty concept. It explains nothing and obfuscates everything. Unsure what you need elaborated.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623105647/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275380972909924356): "Explain to me how this declaration I am making is not automatically and unquestionably true." Yes, I can tell you are about to make some very powerful arguments. It is definitely my burden to disprove you, not yours to substantiate your own claims.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623105224/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275380018689048577): This seems like a rationalization rather than something you've observed or of which you have any real knowledge.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623105841/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275379743425212416): Because I sound to you like I might take a certain position means I must lack the humanity to be upset by cases of unjust police killings? Right. I see some validity in what BLM people have to say, but "systemic racism" is an empty concept.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623104603/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275378634665181186): You think that violent crime disparities arise because blacks are just doing what they feel is necessary to survive? I find that pretty hard to believe.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623104922/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275377300159238144): How did you establish that I am not upset at unjust police killings? Where did I say or remotely suggest that? Do you honestly think the practice of redlining accounts for the violent crime disparities we're discussing? Would you say that to the family of a victim? Obtuse.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623101930/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275370749944123396): "Look up a real estate practice that was outlawed decades ago to account for epidemic violent crime today." That's a cope. No one suggested or is remotely suggesting that black people should be "killed because of their skin colour." Terrible arguments here.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623091558/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275355642878976000): Didn't Trump undo the harsh sentencing law that Biden helped craft?
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623085958/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275351571132559360): Does the present moment really represent a heightening awareness of police state brutality? In order to uproot the "systemic racism" that is the target of these demonstrations, it seems likely that an even more invasive and brutal authority will need to be created.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623084451/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1275348802740903936): It won't.

It's the opposite. When you join the military you become an instrument of the political will of the government. Nothing more.

We get stuff that is awful for us, and on top of it everyone blames people like us for him. It is lose-lose at best, and it probably involves several more losses even than that.

* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522093747/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1263759897084207104): I think Sorel wrote "Reflections on Violence" after "The Illusions of Progress," but I'm not sure. Regardless, in the work of Madame de St√§el he finds a kernel that greatly interests him: "a mission of creation native to violence."

Who was it who said that, when you have standardized measurement of productive output, then you have the fundamental structure in place for capitalism? I don't know. But if someone has a nifty definition, speak up.

Discovering and developing an alternative system is an involved dialectical process, not an item on a fast food menu. No, I don‚Äôt have an alternative ready-made for you.

At a minimum, if we settle for retaining capitalism, then there is no reason we cannot restore New-Deal-style reforms that limit wealth inequality, regulate financial capital, and support ordinary people.

Apparently you think it should be your right to make false, disgusting accusations against me and not be called on it. Not surprising, frankly.

I labeled myself a right-wing Leninist in 2010 to suggest that I‚Äôd apply Leninist institutional strategy against Left-wing institutions, a notion I got from Gregory Hood. It‚Äôs pretty entertaining that you seem to think this is salacious and discrediting.

RC appears to promote NS mostly aesthetically, and reacts poorly to racialists who bring in Leftist economic critique, which is exactly the kind of theoretical fusion that defines 3P.

You can present yourself as a nationalist, but if you attack anyone who points away from liberal institutional and economic foundations, you‚Äôre betraying a liberal mindset.

If you read through and can‚Äôt see/don‚Äôt like my point, oh well. Conservatives will bait-and-switch racial feeling like yours into support for Zionist tools again and again. Another respondent just openly declared he‚Äôd take the bait.

For a lot of people, though, the thought stops with conservatism and ‚Äúrace realism.‚Äù If that‚Äôs where you‚Äôre coming from, then you should be satisfied with people like Giuliani and Bloomberg. They‚Äôre giving you everything you say you want.

Can‚Äôt you tell how much they love me? üòÇ   You‚Äôre just repeating what I literally did not say, and you don‚Äôt care. Stay mad and anonymous on Twitter, loser.

I‚Äôm pointing out that majorities don‚Äôt rule. Look at who does. Are they anywhere close to majority status? Rhetorical. If you‚Äôre still kvetching after I make it crystal clear what I‚Äôm saying, you‚Äôre just mad on the Internet.
* [ 3 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403102159/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1246004981351813120): ... doomed the moment they lose absolute majority status are not making a lot of sense. Challenging the idea that demographics is destiny and suggesting that whites are not doomed is not the same as talking down to people who live in 'hoods like yours. Chill out.
* [ 3 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403094109/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1246004645375299587): You're really torturing what I said. I am not saying that ever regular white person should shut up and deal with life in poor non-white neighborhoods. I am saying that people who say, on the one hand, that whites are rulers and conquerors, and on the other that whites are ...

* [ 3 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403101442/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1246003221350539264): Wait--I have to be living in a violent, majority non-white neighborhood *now*? Damn. I lose. Cannot keep up with these goalposts--they move FAST.

* [ 3 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403113708/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1245994662390902785): Town of 6000, huh? Wow, my memory is terrible.

When I attack conservative racism I‚Äôm referring to people who lack any imagination outside of defending Americanism and disliking other races, i.e., conservative racism. That‚Äôs mainly how I‚Äôve discussed ‚Äúracism.‚Äù Not sure how much I applied that to Rich.
* [ 3 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403100217/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1245991708183191552): I have lived in majority non-white areas. My childhood home was in the Allison Hill neighborhood of Harrisburg. Thanks for playing, tough-guy anon. Better luck next time.

He should‚Äôve just said, ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt apply to me.‚Äù Instead he and his supporters reacted as if Rich *does* behave as I suggested, and defended it.
* [ 3 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403163914/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1245985293460783105): Rich exhibits the tendency as well. I direct plenty of critique at Thompson.
* [ 3 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403134017/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1245984085996158978): Michael ‚ÄúPaul Kersey‚Äù Thompson is a great example. Regularly published at at least two dissident outlets, widely read, very dedicated to the message I am critiquing, ultimately loyal to the GOP. The problem is real.
* [ 3 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403101202/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1245982998551564288): Hahaha yeah, I definitely did not suggest that WASPs run the show, either. Keep swinging.

* [ 3 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200404010322/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1245981344682905600): My original take was an observation that this is how Rich and others often behave. I obviously wasn‚Äôt responding to someone who explicitly declared, ‚ÄúWe should dwell on this!‚Äù
* [ 3 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200404080959/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1245955918178783232): Race and crime are valid topics, but dwelling on them and building a message upon them won‚Äôt work‚Äîthe system is wholly equipped to re-route the discussion and underlying sentiment to its own ends.  Quick‚Äîask  @goodforharriers  what he is not understanding.
* [ 3 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403153845/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1245973085486043137): You‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs not a coincidence. A lot of right-wing racialists really are that stupid.
* [ 3 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403073208/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1245972917059452932): Because you misstated what I said. I corrected, repeatedly. Get help for your dyslexia.

Spencer literally did a whole segment covering New York, stop-and-frisk, and racial crime data just recently. I am obviously not objecting to any discussion of race and of anti-white crime, and have never suggested such.
* [ 3 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403074247/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1245971472973209600): Is it a romantic thing with you and all these straw men?

* [ 3 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403141048/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1245971037382197248): Someone find out if this is an open weight bout, or what. I can get down to 72kg with our too much struggle, but if Rich needs me to drop more I‚Äôll need a heads-up.
* [ 3 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403173619/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1245970083245166592): üëãüèª

* [ 3 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403211834/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1245969699512475651): Mmm, totally.

* [ 3 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403080855/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1245959450751651841): The system has completely co-opted discussion of racial double standards through conservative bait-and-switch strategy. If you still fail to understand this you cannot be helped or used to work towards anything constructive.
* [ 3 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403205242/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1245958281991991297): Cool. The thread is there for people to read and judge for themselves.

Chatting about the unfairness of the debt system to ordinary people is obviously more plausible.
* [ 3 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403085234/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1245956446069690368): This too, very much.

Incandescent rage regarding anti-white violence is not a sufficient basis for getting productive messages across to people. It‚Äôs not a matter of elitism, and the lazy insistence that it is is irritating.
* [ 3 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403090137/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1245955278606041092): üòë

* [ 3 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403090258/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1245953655980916736): I say a thing. You disagree with it, then qualify away your disagreement, then can‚Äôt figure out where the disagreement went and turn to me demanding explanation. Fascinating.
* [ 3 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403071805/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1245952973882171392): A lot of ‚Äúright-wing‚Äù and ‚Äúpro-white‚Äù accounts tweet exactly as Sweden does. It does not hold a lot of potential for disrupting the system. If you‚Äôre woke to black-on-white crime and that‚Äôs all, the system has Giuliani and Bloomberg for you.

But the immigration restriction lobby has failed and minority status is an inevitability for the medium term. Saying that we are doomed when we become 49% is not the right message to prepare for this, but many talk this way.
* [ 3 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200404051736/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1245951327148167168): Right now it should definitely be the structural and spiritual bankruptcy of liberal democracies. The virus has accelerated this crisis and exposed a lot of discussion points.

Is there a competition to be the most pedantic account on Twitter that I don‚Äôt know about? I have to deal with this crap more every day.
* [ 3 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403093832/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1245950106584711168): I didn‚Äôt say or suggest it was totally useless.

The system is wholly capable of co-opting this anxiety. It can‚Äôt be the basis of our discussion.
* [ 3 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403164331/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1245949022524837893): *sigh* Read my tweets, man. This is really tedious.

Anyway, you dgaf, but a throwaway comment about TRS seems to have you eternally triggered. That genuinely surprised me.

Happens a lot in these threads that I rebut something, and then the topic comes up again later as if I'd raised it to begin with.

It might be that there are con-artists everywhere, throughout all institutions and movements, but that the ones who plague us are more harmful because we don't even have our foundation built.

The teenage racial humor is, and it‚Äôs what TRS seems fundamentally based on. To me my take feels pretty well-sorted: credit where due, critique when merited. A take shouldn‚Äôt be so problematic to people. I accept critique and so can they.

Mike‚Äôs coverage of the Cville lawsuit, for example, is vital and probably unsurpassed. His output re: ADL partnership with law enforcement was illuminating to me. Mike is the most serious guy there.

He was always the first to say, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt/must do X bc TRS/TDS will love/hate it.‚Äù He ought to self-reckon on this as well.

This has been part of my take. His current McSpencer lineup is the best ever.

Pretty pathetic that I can‚Äôt express my preference without it causing this level of stir. You‚Äôre right that someone comes across as butthurt, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs me.

Now that you‚Äôre actually arguing for TRS as a model of maturity you‚Äôre getting ridiculous.

I get lots of steaming piles of garbage from TRS cultists in my mentions. As far as its principals, which one was it who made a really hilarious song ridiculing Matt Parrott to death over his public embarrassment?

I think a comprehensive diagnostic review of what happened 2015-2018 hasn‚Äôt been completed, and must be if anyone is going to learn and get things closer to right in the future.

It was a mistake for Spencer to record a podcast with Anglin and Enoch that legitimized Anglin as Alt-Right, for example. But Spencer didn‚Äôt commit this error unilaterally, and there was context.
* [31 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200331075201/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1244890245579014144): I do blame NPI. Blame is shared. Maybe just relax and permit a full accounting of everyone‚Äôs activity to proceed instead of piling on me before I even clear my throat insisting that I‚Äôm only allowed to criticize NPI. Weak.

I exercise my judgment and discuss everyone‚Äôs conduct, including mine and Spencer‚Äôs. If Mike comes apart based on one offhand remark from me, oh well.

The last time I censored myself to preserve an alleged ‚Äúwe‚Äù it ended poorly. Lesson learned. I say what I see, I comment on errors that were made, if it makes you sad, oh well.

A little weird.

I‚Äôve walked a little distance as a doxxed person engaged in activism, organizing, and fundraising, and I see how cheap and often counterproductive ‚Äúedgyism‚Äù is.

It's just that I'm not a ChiCom, and would begin to confuse and risk beclowning myself if I started signaling like one.

I do not mean to be unclear about that.

Disease experts explicitly anticipated it arising as it did, and China failed to shut down the wet markets. Early on, at the very minimum, China failed to understand what was going on and interfered with the medical response.

But Pompeo is pushing for a new cold war with China. If you interpret my lack of energy for Americanism and American foreign policy projects as "siding with China" that's your myopia.

I am critical of racist conservatism as a base on which to root white advocacy, as a frame for understanding other countries and races, and really as a useful mentality for just about anything.

I can see the limit of Radix's appeal, too, but power levers aren't pulled by the middle and working classes.

I don‚Äôt think China is a friend to whites, but why anyone would tether white interests to American national conservatism and choose to die on the hill of a new Cold War with ChiComs is ü§î

How ugly things are in the U.S. and how laughable Trump is are all anyone talks about when the subject arises. Global realignment openly discussed as imminent in national media outlets. But you‚Äôre probably right.

Mike is very intelligent and does a lot of quality stuff, but he also acquiesced in a lot of toxic, destructive activity during the 2016-2018 time frame. No good-faith reason to deny this.

Europe will become less Atlanticist and more Asiatic in orientation. If you want to resist this, you‚Äôre on Team Pompeo. If you‚Äôre on Team Pompeo, you are anti-white. You‚Äôre also on the losing team.

It‚Äôs funny, it‚Äôs popular, it‚Äôs profitable, in contains valuable stuff. It‚Äôs also limited and a valid target for critique like everything else. Should be able to say so.

We can‚Äôt move forward effectively unless we talk frankly and openly about, for example, the missteps we made in 2016-2017 (I include myself, Spencer, etc. in that.)

There is no big tent to prop up.

I‚Äôll keep an open mind and keep looking around, but if that one poorly-written, weirdly-sourced report is what China data truthers are relying upon, I‚Äôm skeptical. To me it just sounds like, ‚ÄúChina bad.‚Äù

Him snorting that I‚Äôm too dumb to understand was typical. Not a serious person.

Onto the garbage pile with that.

My existence and good humor are themselves noxious and infuriating to anti-whites, much mores than  @DuchesneRicardo ‚Äôs cartoon racism. But if you feel I‚Äôm off-base and welcome his rhetoric then identify with him and reject me. It‚Äôs all good.

* [26 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200226093344/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232597530422239232): No. He'll be about the same on all of those things, and at least we won't have many people deluding themselves that Bernie will reverse these policies, like we do with Trump.
* [26 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200226093205/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232597264700510208): I haven't been watching, but I doubt that he "never explains anything." But that aside--do you view your self as a right-wing capitalist, or something else? What is it that you're objecting to?

Expressing qualified support for Bernie is about communicating something and pointing in a new direction for the movement.
* [26 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200226084530/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232587133011005441): Spencer streams regularly on YouTube‚Äîthe McSpencer Group. Unsure there‚Äôs a single stream or clip where he seeks to distill everything. But few if any of us have ever been conservatives, so conservative rage and panic don‚Äôt really affect us.

When I‚Äôve called you on it, you‚Äôve denied ever making this argument. You are at least right that someone in this thread argues like a child.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225214221/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232419175118798853): I appreciate the actual, thought-out observations that you‚Äôve made in this thread. You‚Äôre perhaps the only respondent in this debate over the last few weeks I‚Äôve seen make serious arguments for your position that merit thought and respect. You‚Äôre also not being obnoxious.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225212353/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232414615780384768): You‚Äôre selling stuff everyone knew in 2015‚Äîthat Trump and his movement carry a strong quality of implicit whiteness‚Äîas if it‚Äôs revelatory and weighty in 2020. You‚Äôre literally urging people to hold out for him to do something about things like birthright citizenship.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225210902/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232410691090501632): Really, when you think about it, you can‚Äôt blame Trump for anything. Solid point.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225210604/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232409723766439938): Declining to embrace your bad arguments or obviously-failed pursuits is not nihilism. Get over yourself.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225210349/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232409303438503938): ‚ÄúTrump never cracked down on white activists‚Äù‚ÄîOk. So he just didn‚Äôt do anything while his DOJ and FBI railroaded them?  Every candidate says the save thing about white nationalism and racism. Bernie is not at all unique. If anything he‚Äôs much less unhinged.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225205456/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232406840237023246): I genuinely support his wealth tax, his anti-Zionism, his push to nationalize healthcare, his stance on the minimum wage, and his position on abortion, to make a few.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225204804/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232406069772783616): The direction under Trump is not fundamentally different. You don‚Äôt handle it well when people highlight this, how disgustingly Zionist he is, how savagely he has exposed and cracked down on white activists, and so on. In short, you lack a serious response.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225203555/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232402985835286528): Yes, very apparent from this whole thread how undone I am. I really hope it‚Äôs not public!  Apologies for my foul language, Doctor. You‚Äôre right to support Trump, the cerebral candidate of the urbane and sophisticated. I hear that EO on birthright citizenships is coming soon! üòÇ

That, or for several tweets you literally and simply stated nothing apart from, ‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm right and that you have no argument‚Äù before even exchanging a substantial thought. Maybe, if you try, you can see how this is not charming.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225201021/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232396477265301506): It‚Äôs the natural and proper reaction to your unsubstantiated assumption of vast superiority from the start.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225200933/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232395717609771008): Foul language‚Äîeek!
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225183655/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232372465713713152): Oh yeah, we are spoiled children, and sound like feminists and SJWs, and all these other fey little put-downs that must be very meaningful in your little turtleneck-and-tea-cozy world. And you don‚Äôt come across at all like a condescending fuckface. Really got us there.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225184107/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232371675842387969): Yup. Even generic Dem judicial appointments will hate us less on average than their GOP counterparts.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225182801/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232369294324981762): Not to mention that Trump‚Äôs actual proposed immigration plan is worse for white society then even what currently exists. This has been pointed out several times in this thread.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225182801/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232369294324981762): Even if all of that were obtained, it would not be remotely enough to merit supporting Trump, and at this point would not fundamentally change the demographic situation.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225181532/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232366751133896707): We aren‚Äôt ‚Äúblaming Trump for everything.‚Äù We‚Äôre just being actually sober and realistic about what he has done. Even if we did blame him for everything, it would still be more realistic than imagining he‚Äôs secretly on our side and just restrained by outside forces, as you argue.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225175148/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232357564073086983): That‚Äôs not nihilism. It‚Äôs just accurate.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225170529/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232348350902685696): This is not really true, and it‚Äôs a terrible argument even to the extent it is true. ‚ÄúTrump is exploiting good people, so we should join them.‚Äù
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225170548/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232345697132990466): That escape is vital if we aim to build a successful movement. These endless rationalizations and coping mentalities need to be discarded. They‚Äôre just justifications for endless exploitation by the GOP.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225170548/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232345697132990466): Bernie also is more threatening to a lot of anti-white figures and institutions in a way that exposes them.  But I don‚Äôt expect Bernie to triumph or to succeed in accomplishing much of he does. This is more about escaping the thought-prison you appear to enjoy.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225170548/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232345697132990466): No national political figure will build our movement for us, or really even catalyze it.  Your premise that Trump would improve things for whites if given the chance is embarrassing and unsupportable.  A lot of Bernie‚Äôs policies would benefit ordinary white people.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225171854/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232342942280552448): Trying to throw my argument into some sort of relief by imagining someone trying to bluntly force an uncompromising white racialist platform at a Bernie rally is not serious.  Actually, those who were most naive in 2016 tend strongly to share the mentality you‚Äôre defending now.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225163452/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232339086519816193): Few if any of us literally felt Trump was a white nationalist. Even we did, it does not redeem your bad arguments in the present.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225162138/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232338741370466304): I wasn‚Äôt going to bother but you seem like you actually think you‚Äôre being perceptive, so I‚Äôll spell it out: a lot of white racialists use superficially non-white-presenting avatars to reduce likelihood of account termination. You are not nearly as in touch as you think.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225162107/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232336217884299265): A lot of people were naive in 2016. You still are. That, or you actually thrive off the GOP succubus.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225155950/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232332826881773569): You‚Äôre not helping whites by encouraging them to remain loyal to Trump, to put it mildly. They are being taken advantage of in a very disgusting way.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225154540/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232326870366085120): In practice (and by conservative GOP design) ‚Äúimplicitly pro-white‚Äù means whites energizing a party that explicitly denies their identity and group legitimacy, and that pursues policies that harm them terribly. This appears not to matter much to  @DuchesneRicardo .
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225154540/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232326870366085120): It‚Äôs above your capacity to understand,  @RichardBSpencer . A lot of spirals and tensions. Basically, getting people to hate and attack us while not protecting us and even aggressively prosecuting us is a fantastic thing.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225153808/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232322156442374145): You are putting a word *you* introduced to the conversation in scare quotation marks. Are you disputing your own observation that Trump agitates anti-whites? You seem confused.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225145618/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232318102840332289): Trump is not your secret ally, to the extent that you are pro-white. He is your open enemy. He agitates people against us while declining to protect us. His DOJ prosecutes us far more aggressively than it pursues Antifa. He is also the most Zionist president in history.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225182538/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232317445345382400): You say you know I can‚Äôt have good arguments. Seems far below university-caliber discourse.  If Trump were able to act more freely he‚Äôd follow through on his oft-stated desire to have more immigration than ever.  Agitating anti-whites does not improve things for pro-whites.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225134543/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232296687663820804): Also, indicate me that you understand that good argumentation isn't a zero-sum matter, at least. As in, you may have good arguments, but it doesn't mean I lack good arguments, and declaring so when you know little or nothing about me is hilariously idiotic.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225134543/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232296687663820804): Doing my best to meet you at your level, is the thing. But you're not making an argument. You're making declarations and laying the douchebag condescension on thickly.  Trump "has immigration restrictionists"--anything else? Ideally we'll get around to some substance here.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225131555/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232285257702965249): Confidence from knowledge. Got it. From where does the knowledge arise, then? Am I mentioned in this New Yorker piece? Hoping to get to the bottom of this so I can tap into the wondrous fountain of knowledge on which you rely.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225125826/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232285792145477633): "is implicitly pro-white"--Agree. "benefited white identity politics"--Lol x 1,000. "Bernie means the opposite"--If you say so.  A lot of declaration. Maybe you're used to an audience that takes for granted the validity of your takes. Insufficient here.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225131555/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232285257702965249): "borrowed too much"--If you say so. "don't understand"--If you say so. Unclear wherefrom your self-confidence arises. "how immensely"--Oh buddy, I've shouldered more than my share of that immense difficulty. "presume that"--Made up. I don't remotely presume or suggest that.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225101221/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232245463811837955): Exactly. Adequate Norwegian, especially for a non-native who is out of practice.   @cenkuygur  wastes his time hitting a lot of flat notes like this one. His overall progressive viewpoint is valuable, but he insists upon dumb stuff like this semi-regularly, and it's off putting.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225093249/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232234400454266880): Trump ran on ending the H1-B visa scam. He ended up consolidating it. India is one of the main sources of the cheaper tech workforce he's allowing to come in and displace American workers. So yes, totally inspiring.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225093919/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232232368511029248): I don't want us to form our own echo chamber, so I actually wish our critics would make genuine, substantial arguments, instead of these pathetic bullying attempts.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225075204/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232203171923140608): Snobbery is not a substantial response.

And he shares internationalist notions of the working class, except that his underlying aim is to exploit it, and to displace his own countrymen with it.
* [25 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225054024/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1232172595388309504): If you say so. But, what about MAGA is pro-White? If you decline to give a serious, good-faith answer, I‚Äôll be disappointed.
* [24 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200224174527/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1231995402234232835): Don‚Äôt have to click on any of that to know that none of it contains any evidence that I‚Äôve ever met Miller, Parscale, or the Trumps, because I haven‚Äôt.

I decided to decide this means I could ignore it and pretend you didn‚Äôt say it.‚Äù üëçüèª

This is some bizarro conservative shit.
* [22 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200222213602/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1231330068535877632): You equate ‚Äúimmigration‚Äù with ‚Äúzero immigration.‚Äù I explicitly listed fighting things like the RAISE Act among the causes that I‚Äôd push and that would make sense to many Progressives. No impression made on you, clearly.
* [22 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200222212833/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1231329188055044098): Twitter can be a good barometer of certain things and maybe I‚Äôll eventually get around to publishing a more comprehensive explanation. But the energy I‚Äôm giving to this debate belies how much I really care about the impression I give to Internet ‚Äúactivists.‚Äù

You decline to acknowledge or account for my repeated corrections.

You said I agree with progressives on economics is all, and can‚Äôt name other causes that affect whites that I‚Äôd push. You passed over my dispositive responses to this.

If you insist upon describing yourself as a ‚Äúthird positionist‚Äù to ordinary people you meet, you‚Äôre being spectrumy and wasting time, because they won‚Äôt get it and think you‚Äôre and irrelevant weirdo, and they‚Äôll be right.

Your assumptions are conservative, and you react angrily and unintelligently to departures from the Right. I‚Äôve specifically highlighted your straw men and mischaracterizations‚Äîwhether you notice is up to you.

You don‚Äôt know me!‚Äù reaction at the label, followed by an unreflective litany of conservative assumptions and declarations and a hysterical attack on any suggestion of thought-patterns that tend to live on the Left.
* [22 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200222205714/https://twitter.com/EvanMcLaren/status/1231320509146705920): Two-party parity will be maintained far longer than people in this thread are assuming. The GOP is not in mortal danger.

Second, "if they refuse or delay our service" is a big "if." I don't see that happening.

But this one goes to 11," know that I will become a member of  @Raudt  at my earliest convenience. Stay mad and impotent.

So it‚Äôs all good and everyone should be satisfied.

You‚Äôre a fat piece of garbage, Joe, and you‚Äôre exactly the kind of person who runs his mouth entirely online, with no risk or honor. Hope to run into you one day, but it‚Äôs not likely.

The rally, attended by LOS and plenty of other sensible people, was two years ago. I haven‚Äôt been back to ‚Äúyour South‚Äù since my resulting court date and don‚Äôt have plans to pollute it with my presence again. You sound weird.

Just surprised at how quickly the bottom dwellers picked up on it. Didn‚Äôt think that much attention was being paid to me.

I want away from this kind of thinking and, if necessary, these kinds of people.

They are square on Zionism and foreign policy, I share their positions on a lot of domestic and social policies extending beyond mere economics that would benefit ordinary whites. They are critical of our shared enemies in Silicon Valley. And more.

Your arguments are invalid because they‚Äôre premised on the absence of a critical, determinative schism that matters dramatically more than Left versus Right.

Are you, Leftists, so dedicated to white replacement that you can‚Äôt chill tf out about, even if it could mean a chance at drawing in more support and building a broader, winning coalition?

When Bernie gets tossed again, will you accept that your current progressive base isn‚Äôt wide or strong enough?

If they can't figure out how to adapt and influence social justice narratives, they are pretty incapable.

The heat that has been placed on us, in terms of political stigma, deplatforming, etc., would begin to affect them as well. But if they don't build out from where they are they will continue to lose.

You're disoriented.  If you aren't aware that many Leftists fully grasp that neoliberals and Zionists are their primary enemies and that we make a lot of sense, then you are just uninformed.

Don't be dense.  Zizek is a Leftist who literally just published a piece in a major outlet proposing alliance with us. He is taken seriously by a lot of people.

I don't care about differentiating myself from the Left. I don't care about lEfT and rIgHt at all. I care about defeating capitalists, Zionists, and anti-whites.

If you want to secede and isolate, get busy and start now. Your ideas have already failed.

No thanks indeed.

Instead, a corporate, anti-white, neoliberal class will dominate both "Left" and "Right" establishments. The progressive Left is the populist, working class movement that is and will be disempowered.

That ship sailed a long time ago and was mistaken to begin with.  People will never become zealous anti-zealots who reject social justice wholesale.  If you can't adjust to reality, you're the one who needs jettisoned.

Your critique is fine, and it's not what I'm characterizing as foolish.

Entertaining how you flip from ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt argue‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äôll crush you in any argument!‚Äù instantly. You‚Äôd lose a debate with a sixth grader.

If you feel he‚Äôs wrong about how the thing needs to be conceived and weighted, say so. Regardless, it‚Äôs the coalition that obviously needs to be built.

You are sad and very close to being diagnosably retarded. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so easy to persuade you that Trump is divine.

Engaging with his campaign is about signaling towards the coalition Zizek is trying to describe in this piece and that has yet to be built. https://twitter.com/RichardBSpencer/status/1229807117122428928

Signaling that we‚Äôre on board with much of his program and interested in organizing a coalition that can ultimately succeed is what‚Äôs key.

They bailout their big donors over and over again and saddle regular folks with more and more debt and an ever-worsening economic situation. Most upset, though, with Trump, who signaled populist change and then rolled over.

You just keep doing the same thing you‚Äôve been doing from response one: declaring that I‚Äôm fundamentally driven by fear.

I don‚Äôt perceive what you feel is missing. Regardless, funding our activity and giving it institutional force remains our biggest obstacle.

You decline to say more about the problem except that it is philosophical. If you can‚Äôt offer more then that‚Äôs where the conversation ends. The statement is too broad, I can‚Äôt find a point, and wouldn‚Äôt know where to start to fix what troubles you.

You‚Äôre declaring that there‚Äôs an org that is philosophically serious and asking that others match this quality. A lot of undefined, unexplained assumptions and conclusions in there.

Until the institutional/financial obstacle is overcome all movements are blocked from forward progress, regardless of philosophical quality.

Many people already loathe the current order, actually much more than our enemies say *we* do.

Deciding and splitting energy between crowd-funding and luring to big whale was tricky, particularly with all the other challenges that arose in 2017-18.
