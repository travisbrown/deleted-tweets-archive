* [ 9 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200709183410/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1281295598516342784): @Poppsikle @ThghtCrimesBlog Seems pretty clearly stated . . .
* [ 9 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200709022157/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1281048074689732608): Probably not.

* [ 9 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200709021154/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1281046616871329792): This is some serious shit going down.
* [ 9 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200709013538/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1281038845044121601): Christ was a Galilean (a White man), as were eleven of his twelve disciples (excluding Judas Iscariot, an Edomite Jew. Christ was a direct lineal descendant of Adam, the first White man.
* [ 9 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200709013635/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1281037084115873792): The left is not just trying to install a socialist regime; this is a war to destroy Whiteness, and seizing the US government and instituting a neo-Bolshevik tyranny will be the means to accomplish this. It is a devious plan, being acted out right now. White man, where are you?
* [ 9 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200709005837/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1281028985636323330): This shit is going on everywhere now.

* [ 9 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200709001905/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1281019676747685888): Real Christianity is race-based and race-specific. Adam was the first White man and his descendants, including Jesus Christ the man, are God's people.
* [ 9 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200709002658/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1281019103952506881): He is a drooling, blithering idiot.
* [ 9 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200709001752/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1281018537805361152): Three or four trusted and capable men, formed into "sticks" (tactical operational units). Learn your AO, especially the hostile/friendly assets, make your plans, and carry them out. And then keep quiet about it. The word . . .
* [ 8 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200708235800/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1281013841401278465): If elected, he won't last a year before he's replaced by some far left radical sheboon.
* [ 8 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200708235554/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1281013470964547584): Judeo-Christianity is anti-Biblical. In fact, it is of the devil.
* [ 8 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200708234340/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1281006466946568193): It's hard for me to get excited about doing anything half way. There's no thrill for me in being restricted to 50 mph instead of 100 mph. Do that, and I'll soon be gone.
* [ 8 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200708225827/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280995672871718912): I've been pushing this in my group for over 25 years. Parallel institutions can starve the current system. Withdraw your consent from the extant paradigm and starting abjuring the realm, as it's called.
* [ 8 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200708224543/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280994857935233024): Jews know that of which they are guilty. And they know, way down in the depths of their black hearts, what is coming for them. A real holocaust--a burning in hell--from the hands of an angry and righteous God.
* [ 8 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200708223736/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280994472629698560): RT @BaronStrucker: Funny this ðŸ¤£  Trumpâ€™s attacks on left-wing cultural revolution are an anti-Semitic dogwhistle  They canâ€™t help it. Theyâ€¦

* [ 8 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200708224501/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280992673894002688): These are nothing but religious cucks masquerading as Christians. May they be damned in their lukewarm surrender of our culture and civilization.
* [ 8 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200708223042/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280992057411039233): It's hard for me to get excited about doing anything half way. There's no thrill for me in being restricted to 50 mph instead of 100 mph. Do that, and I'll soon be gone.
* [ 8 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200708175542/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280914961502400512): Enjoying the book!

* [ 8 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200708035954/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280697896103534592): Most have during this one, for sure. It likely will not be any different if Trump wins again. At least a Democrat/Marxist regime might wake up a few more, you would hope. We may well see shortly.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200708021753/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280590554074542080): No he really isn't. But I think he feels the pressure, in an election year, to at least try and hold back some of this lunacy from the Left. His actions, and the continued rampaging of BLM/Antifa, may give Whites a little more time and opportunity to prepare.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707201022/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280588251883921408): You got that right. Anyone who doesn't see this coming is either stupid or wilfully blind.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707195526/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280587901894488064): Influence your non-Whites friends to at least be neutral in the coming storm. We Whites will be dealing with, among others, a lot of anti-White White traitors in our midst before this is all over.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707201331/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280586755578621953): This is part of the Big Lie that our Uncle warned us about.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200708005204/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280586491568066560): There is no "White privilege." There is only Jew privilege. And Jews are now bestowing that privilege on non-Whites. Whites are slated for dispossession, slavery, and extermination. It's getting real, White Man. What are you doing about it?
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707202724/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280585539993735168): This is one of the fundamental facts that Whites must acknowledge and then act upon. Otherwise, we'll find ourselves with no homelands.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707214139/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280584975381753856): Or that silverback from Georgia, Stacy Abrams.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707213815/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280582202531561472): That's right. A Communist show trial.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707214419/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280583382175367168): I didn't vote for Trump in 2016 and I don't support him now. He does not represent me. But I do know that for now, and in the near future, he is the only thing standing between normal people and a Communist revolution. If Biden is elected, he will shortly give way to a sheboon.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707213815/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280582202531561472): That's pretty much what it boils down to. And if you resist, the Feds will arrest you and try you in a corrupt court system that is guaranteed to convict you and punish you severely. This is what counter-revolutions are made of.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707203007/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280559679874011142): Establishment traitor.

* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707213036/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280558255979130880): Fuck this shit.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707213821/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280553123472236544): Diet is super important for good health. I have been on a keto/carnivore diet now for a few years. Never felt better (well, maybe at 20). Eat well, stay well. And stay away from doctors, hospitals, and Big Pharma.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707194750/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280552307164241920): Intermarriage, government posts, control of banking & media, as well as a major influence in academia & publishing. Have taken complete advantage of Germany's WWII defeat and the subsequent fiction called the "holocaust." Made the "civil rights" movement and fostered White Guilt.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707184139/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280551419783737344): These people were too lazy and stupid to make a wheel or a boat. They built villages miles from any water source and then hauled water on their heads. Banana Culture at its finest.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707175333/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280550659582947328): We've had a Jewfish and Baboon invasion. We've also suffered from a Wandering Jew invasion, which has replaced the kudzu and pig weed.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707203309/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280522030174007296): Looks like my IRA boys!

* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707033811/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280341329826902019): If it was 1860 (or maybe even 1948 with the Dixiecrats) I could be happy being a Democrat. But today, I'm a White/Southern nationalist without political representation.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707031034/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280336105796063234): That's right!

* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707031107/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280335538059309062): True, they were. We still have some fight left in us, Sir.

Such an absurd notion cannot be allowed to stand. Everyday, in millions of examples, it is proved to be a lie.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707023813/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280326130436681729): Good.

* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707015141/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280317779761958913): If a man ain't a man, then he ain't much. My father used to say something like this. Be a man, always. Otherwise, you're a harmless sheep. Be feared and respected instead. You'll enjoy your life more. Try it and see. And your woman will love you for it. She will . . .
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707015055/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280314502450262017): Good to see you here again, Sir.

They knew that the "civil rights" coalition was anti-White from the start. Too bad more Southern men didn't stand up then and stop this shit in its tracks.
* [ 7 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200707011653/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1280307978504044545): Who gives a fuck?

But black desires for segregation mean they want their own spaces, without Whites, but they also want to be able to use White spaces.
* [ 6 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200706020007/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis/status/1279957228615684097): So why aren't there four famous Indian chiefs carved into the side of that mountain?

Starve the bastards out. They are vulnerable. How secure is their electric grid?

This is going to devolve to a matter of protecting the countryside, towns, and even separate neighborhoods.

When that happens it will be up to you to defend your brothers when falsely charged.

That conflict is over and another one, much different in nature, is upon us. But I will say this as a Southerner, my ancestors were right and should have been left alone to govern themselves.

Form "sticks" (tactical groups) of 3-4 highly-trusted individuals, learn your AO (Area of Operations), & get active. Use your imagination & practice operational security.

The unseen world can visit vengeance unimaginable. From the shadows.

I'd guard it like a pitbull. He will be on the list because in 1272 he wisely banished the Jews from his realm. They were not readmitted until the 1650s by Oliver Cromwell, a very foolish man.

Inanimate objects such as statues and monuments don't fight back; flesh and blood objects, the people who are represented by these statues and monuments, do fight back. Justice is coming.

If they succeed this time, in the US and Europe, these children of the devil will control the world. But of course it will be only temporary control.

Once the new regime is in power, it makes laws that most everyone will fear to disobey.

You could avoid fighting at all if you would only submit to the Left's demands. You could continue to live and not die. But what sort of life would it be? See what I mean?

That is the final step in your disappearance from history.

I recognize it, you probably recognize it too. But most of our people are still asleep or, at best are just waking, unaware of the seriousness of what is coming upon them. I pray it's not too late for us all.

What they want is to replace the current police with another organization of their own choosing. They will use this organization then to terrorize Whites. I can see gang-bangers as "cops."

During the French Revolution, the leaders crowned a whore in Notre Dame cathedral as the Queen of Reason. Today, a drug-addled negro criminal is given the status of a saint. Inversion.

America has become a ridiculous leftist parody of a country. Can you imagine what Washington, Jefferson, Madison, et al would think?

But Whites will give away their country to atone for a single alleged crime one of their own commits against a non-White. Whites with this attitude are being prepared for a literal slaughter.

Everything non-Whites demand is being granted, without so much as a protest, much less a fight. White officialdom is giving away the country founded by their ancestors.

I am proud of what God made me to be. I will bow the knee to no one except my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. As a descendant of Adam, the first White man, I will fight for the blessings God has so generously given me.

If I ever have to be taken to an underground bunker to get away from them, just shoot me. I couldn't bear to look myself in the mirror if I was that weak.

At that point, you have to develop the skills to use it effectively. And your time is getting short. Act now!

At that point, it will become an all-out race war. The US government will side with the non-Whites. Get ready White Man.

This, however, will not happen because it would help thwart the anti-White "Agenda."

I was there, on the front lines, facing a hostile Antifa & BLM. What the plaintiffs' attorneys in Sines v. Kessler are saying is the truth is nothing more than lies. There is also video evidence to prove it. Spread truth!

But we had to live with blacks; they largely didn't, at least until recently. Now, they are finally learning what we've know all along. The South was, and is, right.

The enemy--Jews--will unleash a barrage of lies about the narrative of that event. To counter, every nationalist ought to spread the truth of it all over social media and elsewhere. This is war!

Embrace Freedom. Remove your Mask.  Step over the line.  Get your hands dirty.  Sheep Obey. Men think first.  A mask is a barrier to your humanity.

The victory of Cromwell and the Roundheads over Charles I and the subsequent re-admittance of the Jews into England in the 1650s, and the arrival of William and Mary and the subsequent establishment of the Bank of England in 1694 were disasters.

Can you imagine the media-inspired outcry if there were elderly blacks being beaten by Whites in nursing homes? Whites are the targets today.

But everything being said, I maintain the weight (from 215-220) I was at when I graduated high school in 1970. I am 6'5" and have been since age 15.

I try and get at least 7-8 hours of sleep a night. Good sleep keeps you young and healthy. If you are a man, it will increase your testosterone level (so will a cold shower, fellas).

I never count calories or fat grams. I do limit protein, as too much is not good for you. But there is a wide latitude there depending on size, activity levels, etc.

All diets that have calorie restriction as their principal factor will fail you. Don't waste your time and money, and your health. So what should you do to get trim and healthy?

We eat all the time: three meals a day and snacks right up until bedtime. We eat prodigious amounts of carbs. We don't do meaningful exercise (the kind that actually hurts!). And we get fat and out of shape.

When I was a boy and a teenager (1950s and 1960s), it was rare to see a truly obese White person of any age. What has wrought this drastic change? Mainly our diets and eating habits.

It should be a national tragedy for our people,

In many ways, this keeps their economy afloat; keep yourself fit; learn how to use their technology but don't become dependant on it. Learn old-fashioned skills;

Generally speaking, withdraw yourself from their System as much as possible. Learn to barter, deal in cash in an underground economy; don't give in to the siren's song of "politics as usual;" stay away from doctors, hospitals, and pharmaceuticals.

Most normal Americans know something is wrong and may even have detected generally what it is and who's behind it. But they have never acted in their own collective defense before and simply don't know how to withdraw that consent in practical terms.

We are assaulted on all sides, all the time. Ready to fight back?

This is fundamentally psychological, but it will eventually have concrete ramifications. If you must still obey illicit laws, do it grudgingly and only because you are forced to do so.

His cities became shit holes filled with crime; his schools are ruined; his borders thrown wide open to the 3rd World;

I want to live in a White ethno-state in which only Whites are citizens, with all that that status confers. In other words, I want my country to be White Man's Land, like we used to have . . . when we were free and prosperous, as well as safe.

I've not been fearful of anything concerning it & I have not voluntarily complied with any of the diktats issued by government at any level. My gym's closed temporarily, so I work out at home.

They are truly deserving of a place in the lowest circle of Hell.

That's how a White Man, a gentleman, ought to act. A man who fears battle will take out his aggression on those weaker and more vulnerable than he. Usually a woman.

They wormed their way into power slowly and steadily, from the very beginning. But the last 100 years have seen them accelerate their program, especially in government, banking, media, and academia.

This is the culmination, or so it seems, of a long-standing Jew plan to subvert and destroy the White Man's civilization by destroying the White Man himself. I guess it's time to fight . . . again.

For instance, some 75% of states have fewer overall deaths in the first 4 months of 2020 than they did in 2018 and 2019. This is according to CDC figures as well!

Compare America in 1900 to today and you'll understand.

And I wish that we would have won. The world would be a different place. There likely would have been no world wars in the 20th century, at least not as it worked out. The South was America's stabilizer, and it was destroyed.

It began, of course, with the South's military defeat in 1865; however, it really took off when the Jew began to worm his way into position of authority. The US became the Jews' golem (look it up).

My ancestors made the stuff here in the Upland South. They were run out of business by interests, ultimately Jewish, who persuaded the US gov't. to declare war on my enterprising forebears. Jews still control liquor.

If you do well as a non-Jew, it takes away resources & opportunities from Jews, according to the rules. Thus, the Jew can only do well when their rivals/enemies do poorly. If you forget this fact when dealing with Jews, you lose.

That's why they want it for themselves and seek to deny it to everyone else. This is beyond mere hypocrisy. It is a fundamental survival strategy in their eyes.

It is that serious. Prove me wrong.

Those who are pushing for estrogen-laden plant-based "meat" are my natural enemies. My people (northern Europeans) are biologically adapted to eat meat as the mainstay of our diet.

In many ways, it is the key to perfecting the other two realms and establishing harmony between a man and woman that transcends physical matter and cold rationality.

Now that I'm older, I find the company of a smart woman very pleasurable. Life is not only the physical, it is also the intellectual and the spiritual. All three combined make perfection.

But about the human/demon thing, Whites are the descendants of Adam; thus we are actually THE humans. And Jews, by their nature--physically and spiritually--are the demons among us.

Communism is alive and well among the ruling elites in the West. It is their regnant ideology. And it was not the Nazis who literally migrated to America; in fact, it was just the opposite.

The obvious problem is that you really don't know, at least at first, who you are really communicating with. Online acquaintances that lead to in-real-life meetings can be good.

Most of the true nationalist women I've met are serious and dependable. They are not, of course, warriors fit for combat. But they will be invaluable in other ways to our cause.

I have seen real-life situations before in three geographic areas in which we would have been much worse off w/o the solid efforts of our women.

Some sort of unity, if nothing more than good communications for now, is necessary. That'll especially be true the closer we get to the tipping point in all this. At that point, the disparate parts will need to coalesce.

It is a God-given sixth sense, made to protect her against both predators and competition from other females. It's a very fundamental, primitive aspect of femininity. It's best not to ignore these things.

One to ostensibly oppose the other: thesis + antithesis=synthesis. And the synthesis is the technocratic surveillance state wherein the 1% dominates the 90%. The other 9% or thereabouts are enforcers for the 1%. Your future?

In fact, the entire American system has been turned against you. Your move.

But the stock market and international trade took precedent over the citizenry's safety. Globalism rules.

But in real reality, as it were, things are usually the polar opposite of nearly everything you see on TV, both programming and commercials. This of course includes movies too. Don't be fooled into believing lies.

Less Southern blood sacrificed for Israel, I hope. We need that blood here, to save the South.

But this is no longer a system of justice but one of revenge on the part of Jews and their allies.

I care about my reputation only in the eyes of those whom I love and for whom I fight. This attitude has simplified my life.

I fought in the first post-WWII campaign to save a White country from being overrun by the forces of Judeo-Communism. I hated civil rights and chopped down trees. And I thought a woman's proper place was in the home. My generation bears this collective guilt but I don't.

Traditional Christianity is the White Man's religion.

The Middle and Near East 2000 or more years ago was demographically much different than it is today. Galileans, for instance, had typical Aryan features. Christ Himself, according to Pilate and others, had blondish hair and light eyes.

Those were different days, when a professor would assign David Irving.

This is the sort of courage our enemies fear we will have. I'm not saying we should tempt God by doing rash, foolish things. But we should never fear to do right, even if it means facing danger and dangerous odds. White men, find your duty, devote

Jackson, as well as his Commanding Officer Gen. R. E. Lee (and many other of our leaders) knew that a man's highest calling was to do his duty, honorably and without fear, in the firm knowledge that he was

Thomas Jonathan "Stonewall" Jackson was a fearless warrior because he understood one thing: that a man lives his life until God determines otherwise, and not one moment before. Thus, Jackson knew he was as safe in his saddle in the middle of a fight

That way, it lessens the shock of it when you come awake suddenly at 3 a.m. (Some of y'all know what I'm saying!). But by God's grace, I've lived.

But if you think you can win, & study how to do it, then you just might win. So it's no contest for me between defeatism &  a studied, realistic optimism. With the latter, at least you have a chance, and if you don't you die honorably.

I've had the pleasure of smoking many good cigars with him, drinking whiskey (or in his case, gin) and watching some movies from his incredible collection. He is an expert of the subject.

In order to assure safety from victimization, Jews can proactively seek to use their power to neutralize/destroy all threats.
