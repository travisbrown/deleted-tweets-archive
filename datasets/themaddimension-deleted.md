Without exception it is generic Left-wing pablum.  Modernity is turning our mental landscapes into strip malls. pic.twitter.com/195YA9APQR

To paraphrase Bob Dylan:  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll grift you when you're walking on the street He‚Äôll grift you when you're tryin' to keep your seat‚Äù https://twitter.com/GoAngelo/status/1432192528661504005

Would this be because he has alienated all of the colleagues who he might be able to work with on legislative priorities like immigration?
* [29 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210829000520/https://twitter.com/TheMadDimension/status/1431769862548885511): Apparently there was only one episode and it premiered on something called the Vyre network. https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/critically-acclaimed-series-cracka-drops-the-experimental-episode-june-19th-or-juneteeth-exclusively-on-vyre-network-301287990.html

I was checking in on it. Apparently it was canceled because Leftists didn‚Äôt want to sympathize with the Neo-Nazi and didn‚Äôt like depictions of blacks as violent rapists ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mTGepCdvfD8

Every decade after that the population dropped of precipitously.  Supposedly from young people leaving for better jobs in the city.

Because of the lawfare waged against me I have increased my understanding of the law, my fundraising abilities, my research capabilities & confronted my own weaknesses so that I can grow as a person.
* [27 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210827174944/https://twitter.com/TheMadDimension/status/1431294711122341889): They‚Äôre not Lincoln, so no.

They oppose feminism, abortion & liberalism‚Ä¶ they might as well be white supremacists! pic.twitter.com/UEStEqiV6y

The Taliban did not attack us. We should not have been in their country and many nationalists on the right are happy they regained their independence from empire.

They‚Äôre quote tweeting an Antifa acct btw pic.twitter.com/NdEnhXGz5I

Both of you are basing ‚Äúvery professional‚Äù analysis on a left wing extremist (ahem) ‚Äúantifascist‚Äù account. Foxes guarding henhouse

* [26 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210826212737/https://twitter.com/TheMadDimension/status/1431001695748767750): The same Woke generals who mangled the withdrawal are the ones who want us to trust them with a commitment of more troops.   Whose to say they didn‚Äôt fuck it up on purpose as a power grab?  #Afghanistan  https://twitter.com/osinttechnical/status/1430957519535583232
* [26 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210826202341/https://twitter.com/TheMadDimension/status/1430971062657880065): And by empowering I don‚Äôt mean even more guns. I mean intelligence and logistical support for finding and engaging ISIS leadership and infrastructure.
* [26 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210826202341/https://twitter.com/TheMadDimension/status/1430971062657880065): Seems to be that Taliban are victims in the  #Kabul  attack every bit as much as Americans are.  We should be empowering them to stop ISIS from spreading, not re-engaging more Americans in the conflict.
* [26 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210826183955/https://twitter.com/TheMadDimension/status/1430948756443250691): That has nothing to do with the fact that Communists have killed 100 million people, far more than the Nazis.
* [26 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210826184441/https://twitter.com/TheMadDimension/status/1430947823378485249): We are seeing a MASSIVE mask-off moment regarding  #BlackRibbonDay .  It‚Äôs become something of a coming out for radical Communist sympathizers in positions of power and influence.  This, of course, is the Revolution chugging along as planned. https://twitter.com/benjaminnorton/status/1430007106405535744

One of the White guy‚Äôs criminal charges was from trying to slap the black guy‚Äôs phone
* [24 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210825020836/https://twitter.com/TheMadDimension/status/1430246027165151234): The last year has convinced me people whose moral compass centers around being a ‚ÄúRepublican‚Äù or a ‚ÄúDemocrat‚Äù don‚Äôt have any firm values and will shift to whatever their leaders or the TV set tell them.  Pro-war or anti-war is just the flip of a switch controlled by TV execs.

You do have to stand your ground at some point.   If you want to keep real free speech and assembly alive. https://twitter.com/realjamesklug/status/1429599271028871174

This was a "hate crime" targeting these Christian protesters. Of course, it won't be charged that way.  Marquez does a podcast with Antifash Gordon where he regularly endorses extreme acts of violence.  #Portland  https://twitter.com/DrewHLive/status/1429642842691891206

If you aren‚Äôt thinking, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the worst thing a vengeful Left-wing prosecutor could charge us with?‚Äù you‚Äôre doing it wrong. https://twitter.com/elijahschaffer/status/1429590250335052075

It‚Äôs just silly to expect police to shoot someone who has surrendered even if they‚Äôve done something atrocious in the past.
* [22 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210823044434/https://twitter.com/TheMadDimension/status/1429486388064497674): J6 wasn‚Äôt a permitted assembly, so a little different. No real Antifa presence either.  There is also a shifting attitude towards law enforcement as the right wing perceives that they are being selectively target.
* [22 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210822214147/https://twitter.com/TheMadDimension/status/1429481980501106694): The right wingers. Whatever you may think of the right wing they do not attacked left wing assemblies. It only goes the other direction.

* [22 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210822224018/https://twitter.com/TheMadDimension/status/1429450519475523586): I'm not sure I'd go that far without more evidence but it is a fact that Twitter is picking winners and losers.  Most of the boosted accounts seem to be Tucker Carlson guests and accounts that are typically thought to be influential on his writing staff: Pedro, Beattie, BAP, etc
* [22 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210822224018/https://twitter.com/TheMadDimension/status/1429450519475523586): Its weird how Twitter‚Äôs algorithm brute forces accounts you don‚Äôt follow into your feed.  Since that Second City Bureaucrat account got active again, I see his tweets more than people I actually follow.

Going to UVA was a completely useless experience, in my opinion, other than the ego validation of saying you‚Äôre college educated.  Did not help with job prospects. https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1428891884655628288

Nearly half the deaths in the entire country are in New York, presided over by Andrew Cuomo.  Cuomo has deep ties to almost all of the Kaplan sphere people, financed pro-Antifa propaganda, etc

The calculated move of the Alt-Right leadership, Spencer included, is to curry low key favor with the DNC by proving they can be an asset in taking down Trump.

Even I was surprised he didn‚Äôt file his own lawsuit.  He hasn‚Äôt done jack shit to help anyone but himself and he isn‚Äôt even doing that right.

This is about a private, unnaccountable organization setting themselves up as a Extrajudicial Law Enforcement entity for the policing of  Americans First Amendment rights.

Some time after it expires a judge will compel the plaintiff to show good cause why the case should not be dismissed.  At that point, pretty much any excuse can be given, along with a request for additional time.

If he has insinuated himself into the the Fuentes circle that is significant.  Former Spencer lackey, Baked Alaska, is reportedly working for Fuentes now.

I do not think it is a viable option for the United States.  I have no problem living alongside other races. I simply don‚Äôt want to see whites disenfranchised.

The man in the leaked recorded is his true self.  However, I can say that his emphasis on publicly supporting socialist candidates is a tell about his closeted National Socialist philosophy.

He is one of the few self-professed White Nationalists who is not really a National Socialist in disguise.  I support civil rights advocacy rather than ethnic nationalism but his lack of race hatred puts him leaps & bounds beyond others.

I think if you asked them what the primary impediment to their world vision is, and they were in private company, they‚Äôd answer ‚Äúorganized Jewry‚Äù.  I think that is a cop out for a lack of agency within the European-American community

I dont think it helps
* [ 6 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191106192549/https://twitter.com/TheMadDimension/status/1192159742665383944): It‚Äôs a waste of money, sure. But there is lots of pork barrel in the government. There are lots of corrupt lobbies in Washington DC.  The hyper-focus on Israel is related to the belief that all European-American problems are the result of a Jewish conspiracy, which is unhelpful

The ‚Äúpro-white‚Äù tendencies of the far right are secondary to carrying on the legacy of the Third Reich or Klan.  I think that is a fatal flaw that will always end up in a dead end & defeat any good that could potentially be done.

But I‚Äôm promoting baby steps considering how far off the mark we are right now.  Besides that, I think we can trust that non-white groups are already sufficiently covering the interests of their people.  Tend ones own garden, basically.

But they can‚Äôt even agree that the Spencer rant crossed the line so...

The far right consistently criticize Mainstream Conservatives for ignoring interests of White Americans while obsessing over Israel  Yet, the far right itself obsesses over Israel, which is at best peripheral, more than any actual issues effecting White Americans

WRONG.
