* [10 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210910035450/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1436171276763160579): We don‚Äôt flip flop over here.

I would end my relationship over my partner pressuring me to get that vaccine.  I would disown family members that coerce me to take that vaccine.  I won‚Äôt get it, and refuse to (because there‚Äôs no justifiable reason).  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
* [10 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210910031822/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1436167136372744196): RT @RAMRANTS: No government should be able to force a vaccine on a general public that predominately doesn‚Äôt need it.  COVID-19 isn‚Äôt Ebola.
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902145549/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1433435659981688835): People who want the Supreme Court expanded simply because they didn‚Äôt get their way‚Äî are the worst.  Doesn‚Äôt work like that.
* [31 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210831042439/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1432559893375029253): Americans still stuck in Afghanistan probably have a better chance leaving the country by identifying as refugees.  Absolutely appalling time in our country.

* [ 4 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210804122420/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1422896023073034247): I‚Äôm not gonna lie.  I get a guilty pleasure out of watching Obama be shamed out of having the super-spreader 60th birthday party he wanted.  If I have to unnecessarily wear masks and have my life restricted over this pandemic‚Äî so should he.  Sucker.

So thankful for the opportunity to spend the weekend with these amazing patriots, networking, team-bonding, hearing from inspiring speakers, & learning more about inner workings of this amazing organization.    #CLS2021  was a complete success! pic.twitter.com/47RNTImqyC

* [17 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210717102437/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1416343038687854594): You‚Äôre literally putting words in my mouth.  Blocked.
* [17 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210717101001/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1416339361709314050): First of all, I am Black. Watch your mouth.   Second of all, you get off your ass and make a show with dark skin characters‚Äî instead of imposing your entertainment preferences on people who see the world differently than we do.  Entitled asses.
* [16 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210717101001/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1416339361709314050) ([live](https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1416108297338425345)): Thought I read it all, but missed that. Also, S. Smith is darker than her non-white costars.  Just feel you‚Äôre jumping to conclusions too early. What if a ds character emerges (like Tika Sumpter in the original)?  She wasn‚Äôt a main character, but the representation was there. JS!
* [16 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210716083241/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1415952432937455617): I‚Äôd totally agree‚Äî if Gossip Girl wasn‚Äôt literally a show about elites that bully folks. And if you‚Äôve been reading the fan reviews, people seem to like Monet more than Julien and Zoya (because them being so nice actually makes her boring).  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a race issue here.
* [16 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210716083241/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1415952432937455617) ([live](https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1415947328087789569)): It‚Äôs Gossip Girl and the all-white cast was way worse.
* [16 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210716080004/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1415944271325192194): It‚Äôs Gossip Girl. The all-white was even worse. üôÉ
* [16 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210716080004/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1415944271325192194) ([live](https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1415877420540960769)): While I agree colorism, in general, is an issue in the entertainment industry, it‚Äôs worth mentioning actress that plays Monet De Haan in Gossip Girl is darker than the writer of this article. pic.twitter.com/J5Ta1cli4G
* [ 4 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210704191154/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1411764607857790978): Patriotism ‚â† Political Affiliation, but you tried it. üôÉ pic.twitter.com/Nzk5KlN7TM

To those that don‚Äôt, be thankful you have the freedom to be so ignorant (because citizens of other countries aren‚Äôt so lucky).  God bless! üá∫üá∏
* [28 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210628013147/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1409323527220588544): While I‚Äôm happy for everyone out there getting engaged and/or married, I‚Äôll never understand the rush.  I won‚Äôt even entertain the concept unless I‚Äôve been with my significant other for 5 years, know their debt to income ratio is low, and credit score is good.  No risks over here
* [18 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210618041543/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1405740949771218958): I know you won‚Äôt, but do the right thing,  @GavinNewsom . https://twitter.com/chatterboxkeirn/status/1404383719759089671
* [18 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210618000534/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1405677977094868993): @Andy  is truly doing a disservice to the entire the empire he helped build‚Äî if he enables that criminal to continue torturing her husband‚Äôs victims by allowing her to flaunt a facade. After watching The Hustler & The Housewife, one would truly be heartless to not let her go ASAP!
* [17 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210617235454/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1405675324185088003): Why are you leaving out degenerate rituals (pioneered by heterosexuals) that warrant the presence of exotic dancers, like bachelor parties, or games that feature penis paraphernalia, like bachelorette parties.   Don‚Äôt you dare step to me acting like your side is without fault. https://twitter.com/gymstatuz/status/1405674388075200518
* [17 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210617234910/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1405673889913479171): I only brought this all up because I see more straight people in my social media feeds talking about Gay Pride‚Äî than I do actual gay people.  I don‚Äôt understand why straight people are going so far out of their way to promote something they disagree with.  Seems counterproductive
* [17 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210617234910/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1405673889913479171) ([live](https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1405673615580749825)): I don‚Äôt celebrate Gay Pride for a multitude of reasons.  It‚Äôs too sexualized (disrespecting families).  It‚Äôs too corporatized, thus phony.  It‚Äôs too far-left, so I don‚Äôt want the association.  But I could care less if people want to publicly celebrate themselves‚Äî harmlessly.  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
* [17 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210617234910/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1405673889913479171) ([live](https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1405672068000018439)): How are straight people going to act like Gay Pride equates to LGBT rubbing their lifestyles in the faces of others‚Äî when they have entire public rituals simply for committing to someone else long term and for procreating?  You really should have a better reason than that.  I do.
* [17 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210618000534/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1405677977094868993) ([live](https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1405493236806782976)): Boycotting  #RHOBH  until  @erikajayne  is fired. I can‚Äôt look at any of the housewives the same way (minus Crystal, she‚Äôs fabulous) for enabling that.  I get that this is ratings gold for the network, but having her on the show is literally abusing her husband‚Äôs victims. It‚Äôs wrong.
* [16 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210616042506/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1405018510837886979): I pick myself. That‚Äôs why I have my opinion. You should try it.
* [ 9 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210609043343/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1402483917265915914): The same people that acted upset about fake Trump racism don‚Äôt seem to remotely care about real Biden racism (Hunter‚Äôs n-word texts).  I get that they‚Äôre used to Bidens being racist, but where‚Äôs the consistency?
* [ 9 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210609041510/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1402479307188969478): We don‚Äôt even have to speculate about the trouble a Trump or any other prominent conservative would‚Äôve faced had they repeatedly used the n-word like Hunter‚Äî because our side isn‚Äôt actually racist.  The Bidens will never be able to say the same because they actually are.
* [ 4 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210604091020/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1400741566197637121): Damn.   You let your Granny live like that‚Äî and blame it on Trump?  üíÄüíÄüíÄ pic.twitter.com/6CqXbKZd5P
* [28 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210528042051/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1398131638630899717): While I only really interacted with Foster Friess a few times during work events, I will always remember those moments. For being who he was, he was one of THE MOST personable and down to earth people I‚Äôve ever meet. Extremely thankful for his contributions to the movement!   RIP
* [18 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210518183650/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1394723589551652864): Not at all surprised by those out their intentionally wearing masks more than needed just to not appear conservative.  They are getting less oxygen to the brain after all.
* [13 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210513220342/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1392963791910957059): In less than 100 days, America is no longer energy-independent and gas is almost $6 in some cities.  It‚Äôs getting harder and harder everyday to respect those that brought this upon us because they couldn‚Äôt separate personality from policy.
* [13 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210513175018/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1392899867299618819): Gas is almost $6 in some cities across America.  Biden voters better keep their distance.
* [23 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210423142530/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1385598126728257542): It must be so easy to talk about the way police officers and/or Black people should behave‚Äî when you‚Äôre not one.
* [22 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210422170645/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1385278831183814665): It‚Äôs been rather disappointing seeing so many of my conservative peers forming opinions about things that have happened this week without any compassion, empathy, or general regard for humanity.   A lot of y‚Äôall act Godly, but still need Jesus‚Äî and it shows.
* [22 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210422170504/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1385278405248118788): I‚Äôve gotta say it‚Äôs been rather disappointing seeing so many of my conservative peers form their opinions about things that have happened this week without any compassion, empathy, or regard for humanity.   A lot of y‚Äôall act Godly, but still need Jesus‚Äî and it shows.
* [21 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210421141900/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1384874265917407234): Jim, just admit that you think death is the most appropriate response from police.
* [21 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210421141817/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1384874063584104448): This is a triple homicide suspect (in the attached video). What‚Äôs the excuse here? pic.twitter.com/WNH9E0pLxK

* [21 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210421140435/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1384870624313724936) ([live](https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1384867943066992642)): I get the frustration over the  #MakhiaBryant  situation.  The difference between life and death could‚Äôve been the responding officer using a taser over a firearm‚Äî and we should talk about that.  But let‚Äôs not pretend a knife wasn‚Äôt involved and that lives weren‚Äôt in danger.
* [20 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210420211300/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1384615984829374472): A lot of people that are predominately led by their emotions must feel vindicated right now.
* [19 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210419105315/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1384097689978114049): She‚Äôs a ‚Äúneoliberal imperialist‚Äù for not unnecessarily hurting small businesses and driving up the cost of living of her constituency?  I‚Äôll never get over how you and your ilk dupe people into furthering the wealth gap by begging for more scraps from the bottom of the barrel.
* [19 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210419103951/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1384094143295594499): It‚Äôd be nice if her Democrat peers did as well, but no one is ready to have that conversation (because the party would rather push trash legislation that doesn‚Äôt accomplish anything other than temporarily making folks feel good before it eventually fucks them over).
* [19 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210419103951/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1384094143295594499) ([live](https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1384093556592168963)): $15 an hour is not a ‚Äúliving wage‚Äù when so many businesses can‚Äôt afford it and so many people can‚Äôt afford the increased cost of living as a result.  If Senator Sinema is drinking sangria while wearing a ring that says ‚Äúfuck off‚Äù on her Instagram story, it‚Äôs because she gets that
* [19 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210419101350/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1384087701222150154): Some folks get lobster and all-organic meals on food stamps. STFU acting like sangria is above the poors.
* [18 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210418132703/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1383773903487598594): Black Twitter needs to come for politicians more often because those Lori Lightfoot tweets are spot on.

* [13 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413203325/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1382069343471730691): Running from police shouldn‚Äôt equal a death sentence in a country that federally mandated unnecessary mask-usage and is trying to pass gun control.
* [13 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413002820/https://twitter.com/RAMRANTS/status/1381766011595055107): Criminal past or not, it‚Äôs okay to admit  #DaunteWright ‚Äôs death could‚Äôve been avoided and that police sometimes make mistakes.  Other can justify incompetence on behalf of law enforcement, but I refuse to.  Doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with resisting arrest or looting in retaliation!

When I vacay in Utah this summer, can I get the  @IrisandBeau  facial at Beauty Lab? I want to try your products out so bad, and simultaneously give you and  @heathergay29  my support. üòè
