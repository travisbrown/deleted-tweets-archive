* [ 9 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210709223001/https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1413626463539011584): On Monday, June 12,  @BretWeinstein  and I plan to both livestream ( #DarkHorseLive87 ) and publish a written response to the recent Quillette essay.  Also then: a scheduled segment on chapter 4 (“Medicine”) of our forthcoming book, A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century. https://twitter.com/alexandrosM/status/1412814554510200832
* [19 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210619200402/https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1406341930762457088): Our power has been returned to us, despite making no concessions. We aim to be live at 1:30pm Pacific. https://twitter.com/BretWeinstein/status/1406330755014295552
* [18 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210618194902/https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1405975830094761987): Also this:  https://twitter.com/bridgetphetasy/status/1405622043739975681?s=21  https://twitter.com/bridgetphetasy/status/1405622043739975681
* [ 3 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210618194902/https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1405975830094761987) ([live](https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1400502896093929486)): So when those of us on the left talked about the lab leak hypothesis for over a year, and were called “right wing” as a result, how do you categorize that? Who’s engaging in fake news now? How did the left come to be the demographic that doesn’t understand what science is? https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1400457765814865930
* [24 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210424031113/https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1385793314868240385): One thing I believe is that most of us aren’t fringe lunatics who get off on hating and bullying and silencing a manufactured enemy. Even if it feels good in the moment to score one on line, it always feels better to actually make a connection. 10/

I don’t know what the person who wrote this was thinking, but I agree—New Portland sucks, and the new Democratic Party sucks, and the new national conversation and culture suck, too. 9/ pic.twitter.com/wWNLyDMHaQ

Yes, the police.  I believe in a social safety net, and in creating and protecting a society that has strong & capable people, and that helps those who cannot help themselves. 8/

I am still on the left, because my values haven’t changed. I’m no longer a Democrat though. 7/
* [24 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210424031113/https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1385793314868240385) ([live](https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1385793012182093827)): And on the evening of the Chauvin verdict, there was more. Why? Because the yahoos are, in their own words, “ungovernable.”   The Portland Police Bureau largely has its hands tied. Meanwhile, homicides and fatal car crashes are also way up. 6/ https://twitter.com/PortlandPolice/status/1385096320810053634?s=20

This is the sentiment that you are de facto defending when you claim this isn’t happening, or that all the protest is peaceful, or indeed, that this particular thing has anything to do with protest at all. This is raw, vengeful hate. 3/ pic.twitter.com/RUJaLSjJDS

The night before, yahoos set a dumpster & the bathrooms on fire outside the Apple store. Awning is gone, tree is charred.   Burned to the ground? No.  Insane to accommodate this kind of behavior? Yes.  Insane to deny it is happening? Also yes. 2/ pic.twitter.com/0YTZdq7T3l

I’ve never voted GOP (not that it should matter), and I know—not believe, *know*—that a tiny but rampaging mob continues to do damage in Portland on the regular.

What do jungle boots, crescent wrenches, Comcast, and chai have in common? Join us to find out!  Saturday, April 3, 12:30 Pacific https://youtu.be/BgQhsY1FqmU

Now I know that women who cut their hair magically become men.  https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1369180682631536640?s=20  pic.twitter.com/QH3M4e8FIz

* [10 February 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210210184120/https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1359573107942412288) ([live](https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1359572851288797184)): I was so pleased and honored to have had public, wide-ranging conversations with two amazing women this week: Posie Parker, and Julian Vigo. The conversations are wildly different, and also similar. We talk about sex, humanity and existential angst. Take a listen:  Links ⬇️

Instead of putting things in boxes, or shopping, why not listen to  #DarkHorseLive60 ?  @BretWeinstein  and I will be discussing locker rooms, the brain cases of shrews, and much more! https://youtu.be/kdJIA1G1_KQ
* [19 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201019190214/https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1318266169455828992): Amazing. Thank you again. Yes, the experience of being utterly misrepresented by an institution what had loved and been loyal to, and by colleagues at it, was unlike anything I ever imagined. It did ultimately allow for some greater clarity, though.
* [19 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201019190214/https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1318266169455828992) ([live](https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1318076486880952321)): In light of  @BretWeinstein 's and my conversation about  @roddreher 's excellent Live Not By Lies in  #DarkHorseLive50 , let us remember: that which flatters you is often not what it seems. Do not be fooled by the ascendant ideology. https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1269835093222158337

* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826001313/https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1298412977188507648) ([live](https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1298407568264454146)): “I am dedicated to my craft and to intellectual discourse.”  @EPoe187  was fired from an academic job, and essentially from all of academia, for speech. He does not shy from controversy. He seeks truth with humility. Read his thread. Consider supporting him. https://twitter.com/EPoe187/status/1298301554131427334

He sometimes referred jokingly to himself as a “lil ol’ country programmer,” while working in LA, London, SF. His science brain was formed on the farm.
* [10 April 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180410162818/https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/983743485453811712): RT @JonHaidt: Thread: Mill made three brilliant arguments against censorship. Not the kind from government, but the more common censorship…
