* [19 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201119002754/https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1329219459412799490): As Covid infections surge, please think about the economically vulnerable as well as those infected. This pandemic has been brutal to small biz owners, service workers, and many others. Long-term joblessness stats are rising. Same for hunger. We have to be practical.
* [17 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201117155750/https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1328728841477558278): "Humane tech" should be thought of as a worldview, not just a UX philosophy.

Open to being wrong here!
* [16 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201116191915/https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1328392976545046528): Unpopular view: Given the geopolitical vulnerabilities during this period, I'm supportive of Biden getting intel briefings to ensure a smooth transition in the event he wins. This seems reasonable as we let legal challenges & the electoral process work itself out.
* [16 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201116144314/https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1328347282769645570): "Get me off this carnival ride" is a real sentiment. A Biden presidency placates this in the same way someone might send their adult daughters off to a "girl's shopping weekend" with Ghislaine Maxwell. Everything is great on the surface, but the bigger picture is really f-ed up.
* [16 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201116162013/https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1328342402826899460): The rot of late-stage empire, the corruption and buffoonery,  deception and denial. The zing of an irresponsible tweet, the zong of a deceptive news. The narrative vertigo from all corners. All on display in the wake of this "most secure election in American history."
* [16 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201116015759/https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1328154920101552130): Understandable sentiment. How do you see this taking shape?
* [15 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201115182836/https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1328042124743479297): Very much agree, and I've been surprised by how many establishment types are already there, on the DL. Part of the challenge is a supply issue - where do they channel their energies? The Trump era has brought awareness and disruption but not meaningful political infrastructure. https://twitter.com/DarrenJBeattie/status/1328028166993145858
* [15 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201115042532/https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1327829828494635010): How about this instead: "There's no excuse for political violence on any side of the political spectrum. Today I'm writing an executive order to prosecute all acts of political violence as hate crimes and to apply the same standard to everyone regardless of ideology." https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1327828007311073280
* [15 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201115025723/https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1327807650000723968): One possible scenario is that there really was rampant fraud but that it is not fully documented until well after a Biden Inauguration. And then, like Russiagate and WMD lies, everyone shrugs and it slips through the cracks of history.
* [15 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201115025723/https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1327807650000723968) ([live](https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1327796405902209024)): Hate to be that guy, but the "voter fraud" narrative is magical thinking without hard evidence channeled through a legal process. Needs to happen within the next two weeks.
* [13 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201113162126/https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1327282007563505665): Here's the 2020 electoral college timeline from the Congressional Research Service. Note that the media has no official role in declaring results.  https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11641

It's hard to imagine a job more symbolic of conundrums about the American dream, tech optimism, and our info environment than this.  @KevinKautzman  saw this early and wrote a play about it.

This is an under-discussed topic particularly among men. It‚Äôs a courageous conversation that will touch lives. https://www.google.com/amp/s/tim.blog/2020/09/14/how-to-heal-trauma/amp/

Pursuing election integrity and ensuring a free and fair election is part of democracy. We are weeks away from January 6th, when Congress declares the next President. pic.twitter.com/plVYVU0748
* [ 9 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201109185113/https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1325872864101339137): False claims are circulating that there is no basis for questioning the integrity of election results declared by the media. This is untrue, subjective, and a form of gaslighting.

Statistical aberrations in voter turnout and ballot counting  2. Software glitches and issues  3. Illegal ballot harvesting  4. Bureaucratic obstruction of monitoring   5. Voter registration fraud
* [ 8 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201108234644/https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1325585452695498753): Real talk / intellectual honesty. I smell the stench of a stolen election but don‚Äôt have the evidence to make that claim with conviction. I do believe there‚Äôs enough weirdness to say ‚Äúlet‚Äôs investigate this & learn more.‚Äù
* [ 8 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201108234343/https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1325584738153852933): Five areas of potential malfeasance worth looking into.  1.

I smell the stench of a stolen election but don‚Äôt have the evidence to make that claim with conviction. I do believe there‚Äôs enough weirdness to say ‚Äúlet‚Äôs wait and see.‚Äù
* [ 8 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201108233134/https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1325581675728936960): Was the election fraudulent or not? Maybe we all need to chill out and let the chips fall where they may as more evidence emerges or does not emerge. We need time to make sense of the complete picture, just as the media predicted.... Time is the answer.
* [ 8 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201108232546/https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1325580253272608768): Seems like a mistake to accept either narrative at this point. Give it time to sort itself out. pic.twitter.com/nJbHRtiUew

* [ 8 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201108135123/https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1325435122632548353): We‚Äôre at the ‚Äúcalling out shenanigans‚Äù phase.   Yes, there is a basis for suspecting voter fraud.  The GOP needs to pursue legal challenges. We all need to let this play out.   Trump likely still loses given the enormous burden of proof, but this is how we get election integrity. https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1322966664485490689

The bar broke out in ‚Äúgod bless America‚Äù in celebration of Biden media pronouncements. It was ... an interesting moment.
* [ 7 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201107205816/https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1325180687243120642): Needs more evidence imo... something worth looking into though.

Refs are held accountable by cameras, instant replays, reviews, and challenges. The winner is affirmed by officials not the media. If only our elections were reffed as fairly & transparently.   Watching  #USCvsASU

* [ 7 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201107144839/https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1325087577574158336): I'm beginning to see a conundrum in disinfo tracking. When do we allow narratives to sort themselves out in a highly fluid, dynamic information environment? Specific claims can & should be debunked but should meta narratives be so quickly dismissed?
* [ 7 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201107143853/https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1325085244035362816): I'd like to see more evidence of these claims, and that appears to be what she's calling for - investigation.

Document suspected cases of voter fraud before, during, and after the election.   Opportunity: provide hard evidence that the voter fraud narrative is justified  Challenge: lots of misinfo/disinfo, fragmented evidence, time-lag issue
* [ 7 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201107140424/https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1325076530637189122): Two lines of effort appear to be emerging.  1) Data analytics. Cross referencing voter data and investigating statistical irregularities.  Opportunity: can be done quickly at scale    Challenge: hampered by deplatforming & constrained by capital https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1325071711952310272?s=20

The burden of evidence is on Trump, and it is reasonable to demand time to substantiate claims. https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/06/ronna-mcdaniel-alleged-voter-fraud-434724

Trump supporters need to do a better job cataloguing and substantiating these claims while cutting through disinfo. This takes time.
* [ 6 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201106204800/https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1324815778441535492): Good clarification: https://twitter.com/ryanseven/status/1324814353699278848

I expect this to be resolved by Inauguration Day with a peaceful transfer/continuity of power.   The long terms effects will likely include continued mistrust and polarization.
* [ 6 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201106204008/https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1324813766324850688): This is a very sensitive moment geopolitically and we don‚Äôt talk about this enough. Anticipate that adversaries may make moves and attempt to sow chaos as we go through this.
* [ 6 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201106203720/https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1324813048939503618): The narrative battle is now between ‚Äúit‚Äôs over Biden won‚Äù and ‚Äúthe legal challenges have barely started - it is far from over.‚Äù

Biden nominally won but much of the public suspects widespread voter fraud. Trump faces an uphill battle in legally substantiating this and forcing recounts, but it‚Äôs not over. Now come legal challenges...

But here‚Äôs the thing. There are enough statistical aberrations and anecdotes to warrant investigation of fraud in some areas. This is what people are pushing for, just as Gore did in 2000. https://twitter.com/mtracey/status/1324691617303961602

People trying to turn this into civil war 2 are bad actors. Don‚Äôt take that bait.

YouTube controls more than 70% of the online video sharing market. Its parent Google controls over 85% of desktop search. This damages democracy.

You're right that it's not a zero-sum game, but the days of putting the American worker on less-equal footing than undocumented and H1B immigrants should end immediately.

We're seeing the results of it now. He will be blamed if a wave of infections follows these protests.  That said - with forced lockdown orders and 22m job losses in the last four weeks, I can't blame people for being angry.

Both were funded by Reid Hoffman via Dmitri Mehlhorn's "Investing in Us". They were run by separate operating units, one via New Knowledge and another that included Evan Coren and Matt Osborne.
