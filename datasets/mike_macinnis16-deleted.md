* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825021113/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298080398568652800): Glad you're safe now.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825020815/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298079566469009408): Small towns in dominant blue areas are easy targets. Just as big blue cities in dominant red rural areas are vulnerable targets. Most Southern cities fall into that latter category.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825020547/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298078887264399362): Good.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825020533/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298078758591594496): Are you close to that area? If so, please keep us posted on what's happening.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825020426/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298078525526687746): I love Robert E. Lee, Thomas Jonathan "Stonewall" Jackson, and Nathan Bedford Forrest.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825020320/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298078271829991424): Had it been a right-winger shooting a liberal congressman, we'd have never heard the end of it from the elite media.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825015953/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298077255806017537): This is a blue urban sprawl zone. Not surprised at the strong BLM/Antifa presence there. Come to Heflin, Alabama, for contrast, a small city about equidistant between Birmingham and Atlanta (two liberal hot beds) and see what you get. It won't be like Kenosha.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825015252/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298075780790939650): With each passing day, one thing becomes clearer to me: America is headed for a full-scale civil war. It will be White v. non-White and White race traitors; rural v. urban; nationalist v. Communist internationalist; among other factors. In fact, this war has already begun.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825014957/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298074913639555074): Hannity is a wind bag. I was on his radio show back in the 1990s and he was one of the most inhospitable and rude hosts I've ever encountered. I'm a Southern/White nationalist; he is a Conservative. Apparently, he saw me as a bigger enemy than the Commies.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825014244/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298073197435183105): Thanks.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825014211/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298073050148003841): Right.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825014024/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298072320334954497): White altruism should only be extended to fellow Whites. It is an in-group trait that is dangerous to us when applied to non-White outsiders. They see it as a sign of weakness, which it largely has now become. Be hard, be tough, & reserve your sympathy and kindness for your own.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825013540/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298071447638704129): There's a reason my late friend Sam Francis called the GOP "the Stupid Party." He called the Democrats "the Evil Party." He was correct on both accounts.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825013352/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298071005210927104): It will be our fight when the Communist street thugs bring their game to the small towns and rural areas of red state "flyover country." For now, we should be content to let them fuck up their own cities and awaken "normies" to their true character. This is beneficial to us.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825013352/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298071005210927104): Violence, or the threat thereof, settles most matters. The hard left (Communists) understands this. The Hard Right (not the Alt-Right) also understands it. At present, the hard left is fighting it out in the streets of leftist cities with the cops. This is not our fight, yet.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825012612/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298068856850640897): Once White Alpha Males were gone (and God willing that ain't happening), then White women would fall into two categories: 1) the good-looking ones would become sex slaves to non-White males; & 2) the sexually undesirable ones would become work slaves. Both would have short lives.
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825012150/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298067952630034433): Why would a man who looks that flabby and out of shape do such a thing?
* [25 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825012143/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298067627105869825): And sort of sissy acting, too, in my opinion.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824235051/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298044849967505408): As I've said, facts don't matter. But skin color does.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824234838/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298044359854579713): Seems like some of these younger guys, viz. Heimbach, Schoep, Spencer, Kessler, et al, have revealed their true colors. Either that or they're just fucking cowards, hoping to "repent" & curry favor with those who persecute (and perhaps prosecute) them. I have no respect for them.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824221645/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298021183556694017): A fine ship, and well captained by RS. A source of pride to my home state, after who she's named!
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824221036/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298019511870816263): Leave out the toast (too many carbs) and I'm in.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824220502/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298018325767712768): A resource I have found helpful is http://Christogenea.com
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824220549/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298017972330496000): Who reported this?
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824220349/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298017778100666368): I understand what you're saying, but for the public who doesn't comprehend police work, the matter of a firearm in the car would go far to make them better understand the immediate situation the officers faced. I suspect there was a gun because nothing has been said about it.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824215923/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298016878393081857): If God is sovereign over His Creation--and He is--then Trump is where he is because it is indeed God's will that he be there. It does remain to be seen what exact purpose Trump will serve, however. But God will use him for His own sovereign purpose. On that we can depend.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824215236/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298015218472071168): A simple question: was a firearm found in Jacob Blake's vehicle? Yes or no? That makes all the difference in the world in this case.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824214958/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298014569160351744): It's all great! The word of the true and living God, revealed to those who have eyes to see and ears to hear. His people.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824214652/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298013818233085952): Read in Matthew 28 where the Sanhedrin bribed the guards at Christ's tomb to lie about the Resurrection, saying that His disciples came and took away the body. "Jews" are liars and are of the devil. They deny the virgin birth as well as the Resurrection.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824214758/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298012704741842944): There's nothing comparable to looking a beautiful girl/woman straight in the eye.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824213456/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298010724778668033): Yes, I see what you are saying now. Thanks for the context.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824213000/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298009597857263616): How did this affect the prophecy? What chapter and verse?
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824212822/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298009110021980160): What was the central focus of the prophecy supposed to have been, had it not been purposefully mistranslated?
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824212316/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298007809213136897): Not "jews." Hebrews/Israelites/Judahites. There is a big difference.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824210534/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298003325426651137): These fools are hopeless. I hope they all get eaten . . .
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824210309/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298002825813716994): Those who have fought, bled, and put their lives on the line for Western civilization deserve respect and admiration. This is not too much for us to demand.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824210114/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298002386674319360): Every black criminal will be "innocent" in the eyes of the non-White and anti-White White left. Facts don't matter. Skin color does.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824210034/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298001967428431872): If it was a '58 or '59, I'd agree.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824205759/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1298001511440461824): And that's an admirable goal, Sir. Very worthwhile, in my opinion.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824204211/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297997603292889088): Technically, Sir, that is a truthful statement.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824204036/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297996915703812098): Black people generally have very low impulse control. Combine that with a low IQ and you have dangerous/dead negro material. This one in Wisconsin is merely the latest.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824203540/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297994727325757441): I wish you all the best, Sir. We're on the same side, just with different perspectives.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824202351/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297992878547808256): Appalachia is already my country, so it's no big deal to me to "lose" NY, CA, IL, WA, OR, et al. I never cared much for them anyway.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824201107/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297989418892972032): This is some crazy shit. Spencer especially.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824195740/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297986414844420096): A little music for a Monday afternoon . . . Stay away from spiders. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0XHIdAWOkk
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824195718/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297986132211150848): Very good!
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824195314/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297985136101744641): I just like spiders, and always stick up for them. I just don't like them in my bed.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824195158/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297983621509201920): But you took a meal away from a hard-working, industrious spider. That will have to be repaid as well.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824194529/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297983326330880000): I'm in the Appalachian South, and that's where I will make my stand.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824194341/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297982771327930370): I want a White ethno-state, preferably in the Appalachian South. This should be our fallback survival strategy when America is no longer salvageable.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824185358/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297970341512265728): Being an older man has its advantages. I prefer real in women, and not just in the breast department. Real in everything.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824185123/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297969524633776128): I think they have, Sir.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824185035/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297969343452442624): Intermediate fasting is very beneficial not only for weight loss but for overall good health.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824170142/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297942004014264321): These are Judahites being spoken of here, not what the Bible would later call "jews." Jesus Christ was a Judahite, not a jew (actually an Esau-Edomite) who subscribed to the Talmudic teachings of the Sanhedrin. That's why they killed Him. This is a very misunderstood matter.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824163019/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297931791941029895): Same here, but diet is more important than exercise. A good diet (no sugar, low carb, medium protein, and high fat) combined with regular high-intensity exercise will get a man fit within a year's time.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824161204/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297927102528811008): You got that right!
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824143558/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297903905448144902): I've seen it, and Rhodesia too.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824023043/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297722716955566080): Hell, I'm ancient enough to have been friends with Conan the Barbarian . . . Watching, hell.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824022029/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297720201086148609): Yes.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824021647/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297719420350074885): You're welcome. Nice pics!

* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824000752/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297686937671786496): No ice cream for me. Sugar is poison. All the other are in my diet.
* [24 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200824000301/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297685548270784513): Agreed. I come from an older generation and was raised by men--father, grandfathers, uncles--who were tough and taught me to be the same way.
* [23 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200823235523/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297683637358526464): Meanwhile, I'm having a drink of good whisky and am very happy with my White self in my White life.
* [23 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200823235125/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297682861131280389): Thank you!
* [23 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200823234708/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297681315270209544): Thank you, Sir.
* [23 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200823231356/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297673276655906816): The only disciple who was truly a "jew" was Judas Iscariot. He was actually a mongrelized Esau-Edomite. The other disciples, along with Christ Himself, were Galileans. They were not "jews," but some were Judahites (of the tribe and lineage of Judah).
* [23 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200823230855/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297671497457324035): Cheers, my friend.
* [23 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200823230302/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297670547325714433): Just opened a new fifth of Buffalo Trace bourbon this afternoon.
* [23 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200823230129/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297670210321879044): I've had some dealings with him over the past few years and I think he is a snobbish fool with no leadership skills.
* [23 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200823225141/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297667809976168451): Who gives a flying fuck who Richard Spencer is voting for?
* [23 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200823224919/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297667068205170690): Me too.
* [23 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200823224711/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297666440074530818): Spencer is the poster boy for soft males. Look at his hands and his demeanor. Softness in a man will get him killed.
* [23 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200823224457/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297665951891099654): Anger is the physical outworking of hatred. Both hatred and anger are necessary in men for the preservation of civilization. Aimed at our enemies, they are the prerequisites for love and peace among our own people.
* [23 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200823223903/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297664486078373888): These days, that's the only kind of "debate" I'm interested in. It really decides something.
* [23 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200823223644/https://twitter.com/mike_macinnis16/status/1297663814905847808): Sir, I beat you by a year, and I did it face to face.

In that movie, Wales declares that sometimes a man has to get "mad dog mean." It's time White men got "mad dog mean." It's either that or die and lose all that matters to you in this world.

Making those ideas translate into reality requires a plan, including lot of logistics. First of all, what is their ballot strategy? "If you ain't on the ballot, you ain't nowhere," as my granddad used to say about third parties.

And they'll all be beheaded, as befits the Old Serpent and his brood of vipers. I chopped the head off my first rattlesnake at nine. Good practice. I hope to do away with a few more before I'm done.

Get out! Worship the true and living God with those who really know who He is. Satan knows!

Mid-19th century northern politics was greatly influenced by the Red revolutions in Europe in the late 1840s. Especially in Germany. Many ex-48ers, as these Marxists were called, came here and helped found the GOP in the 1850s.

They supported the original George C. Wallace and segregation. When the party left them somewhere during the 1930s-1960s period, they had no place left to go except the rancid GOP. We need a new party.

We have a lot of "good men" out there who are doing nothing, and sometimes less than nothing. This needs to change if we are to survive as the defenders of our civilization.

Start by declaring to yourself that you no longer give consent, then find ways to give your decision meaning.

Both are run by jews and blacks for the benefit of non-Whites at the expense of Whites. All I can conclude is that these leftist Whites have a major death wish. This is the finished product of White Guilt.

More young guys need to step out and live life on the edge. Yes, you fall sometimes, but that's where the real rewards are to be found. I could not imagine having lived my life in any other way.

Sometimes it got me angry words and occasionally a slap to the face. But other responses made the risk one worth taking. And, by the way, this was when I was a young man. I'm not young anymore!

And I have always taken what they say about me at face value. I don't believe in playing little games with this sort of stuff. That has served me well so far.

We rural Southerners will be the strong backbone of any White resistance movement against the ongoing attempts to destroy us. We can shoot, hunt, raise our own food, etc. And many of us have military experience. Moreover, we are tough as nails.

This figures, because blacks are not descendants of Adam and thus are not God's chosen, as are Whites. That's my take on the matter.

And it's not the people that inhabit that nest of vipers in the Middle East that goes by the same false name. If America truly blessed the Biblical Israel, these things would not be happening to us.

Whites, largely but not exclusively from the British Isles & northern Europe. Anyone who says otherwise is a liar. Did anyone ever ask you if you wanted multiculturalism?
