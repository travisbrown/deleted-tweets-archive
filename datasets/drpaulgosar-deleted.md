Kevin believes all elections for all races from President to justice of the peace were fraudulent or none where.

Of course the evidence of anomalies , statistical impossibilities and even eye witness statements or last minute rule changes are overlooked.  Which is also classic confirmation bias. A public official should want transparency and provide proof to reassure the electorate.

This is classic disjointed thinking.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see the evidence‚Äù therefore I won‚Äôt bother to actually investigate.  A very poor start.

There seems to be some ‚Äúconfusion‚Äù by reporters who obviously know better.  What is evidence? Eye witness testimony.  So when someone says ‚ÄúI checked the database and I voted in two locations‚Äù that is evidence.  How widespread this is or anecdotal remains to be seen.
