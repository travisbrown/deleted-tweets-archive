We are talking about thousands of Shia who believed they had no duty to defend Ahlulbayt (a.s). Hence Imam Hussain (a.s) only had a handful in Karbala.

Which means the prophetic order was limited to a specific scenario and to Imam Ali (as) alone.

Hence protected and praised by the Imams (a.s).  2- Imam Ali (as) didn‚Äôt order them to not interfere. 1. You can‚Äôt prove it. 2. Some reports say they actually fought back (but later dropped the case).  3- üëáüèº

It would make no sense to:  1- Ali‚Äôs actions determine unity or war between the Muslims. Not his companions.  2- When Abu Lulu did what he did, there was no civil war between Muslims.  A big difference.

Instead he was praised and protected by Ahlulbayt (a.s) and Imam Ali (a.s) himself.  He did his ‚Äòduty.‚Äô

Fourthly, we have narrations that the companions did fight back but were brutally beaten. Point is: They stopped and dropped the case

The Prophet ordered Ali, not his companions. And Ali did not pass that order to his companions.  Continued...

That they were genuinely lonely and strange amongst Muslims. Only Ali was ordered not to draw his sword, not the other Sahaba. They should have defended Lady Fatima and the Imam of their time. It was their duty.
* [19 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200419104417/https://twitter.com/Imamofpeace/status/1251791172688703489): Think about this:  1. why does Imam Hussain (a.s) say: I have not SEEN companions better than mine.  2. why does Imam Ali say: If only I had 10 companions like the companions of Muawiyah.  Because Imam Ali‚Äôs companions were mostly traitors. Especially in the attack on Fatima (as)
* [19 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200419104417/https://twitter.com/Imamofpeace/status/1251791172688703489): You have my book. There‚Äôs a chapter where I discuss hypocrisy towards companions. What about Imam Ali (a.s)‚Äôs companions who betrayed him? Nahj al Balagha is FULL of Imam Ali‚Äôs discontent with his companions.

* [19 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200419112905/https://twitter.com/Imamofpeace/status/1251788803477364737): Compare Kumail with Sa‚Äôsa‚Äôa bin Sohan who Imam Ali (a.s) had appointed in Bahrain. He came riding his horse with an army. He arrived one day late and then joined forces with Al Mukhtar. His brother, Zaid, was alongside Imam Ali in Basrah, ignoring Aisha‚Äôs calls for his help.
* [19 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200419083041/https://twitter.com/Imamofpeace/status/1251788304652988423): The same can be said about Kumail. He was in Kufa and had command over a massive tribe yet abandoned Imam Hussain in Karbala. The excuse was that he wanted to live to report to the Shia what happened. That‚Äôs the job of the Imams Sajjad and Baqir (a.s) and Sayida Zainab. Not his.
* [19 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200419083041/https://twitter.com/Imamofpeace/status/1251788304652988423): Furthermore, we have other examples to draw comparisons from. Hijr bin Adi spat in the face of Imam Hassan (a.s) over his treaty with Muawiya. (Some say) he later apologized. Either way, does that mean he deserves a Shrine? No. Shia built shrines for whomever the Nawasib killed.

Nobody disputes that he returned and was accepted by Ahlulbayt (a.s). The question is: After his return, does he still maintain the high and noble status he had before? Or do we handle his case with precaution?
* [19 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200419122539/https://twitter.com/Imamofpeace/status/1251785612308316163): As for Imam Sadiq (a.s), he has the most heartbreaking saying ever which reflects this reality. He says: In Islam, people can regain their belongings with 2 witnesses. Yet we Ahlulbayt have tens of thousands of witnesses but cannot regain our rights back.
* [19 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200419122539/https://twitter.com/Imamofpeace/status/1251785612308316163): Ammar and Bilal are not among the ‚Äúrighteous Sahaba.‚Äù Ammar became a Murtad, but later returned. Bilal rode his horse and abandoned Ahlulbayt (a.s). Imam Baqir (a.s) says: Only Salman and Abu Thar remained, but only Al-Miqdad was a true Sahabi.

If I harm you, you need to forgive me in order for me to be forgiven. God cannot forgive me without your forgiveness. Doing that would be unjust to you and your rights.

Some scholars believe he was raised to the heavens and still lives, others believe he died. Either way, he is awaited at the end of time.  This is due to the belief that Jesus is simply too great to be crucified.

In the Quran, God (Allah) clarifies that there are creators other than Him:  *Creators* pic.twitter.com/RYwej6Uffh

In Islam, Jesus has several names, one of them is Ruhullah, which means ‚ÄúThe Soul of God.‚Äù Many Muslims are named after Jesus, specifically this name. One of them is Khomeini.(He was nothing like Jesus) pic.twitter.com/csN4fQByeM

A creator doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be ‚ÄòGod.‚Äô As both Muslims and Christians believe: With the permission of God (The Father) Jesus can create.   In the following verse from the Quran (5:110), we read that: pic.twitter.com/NqbSi9j1nZ

Muslims (and Jews) don‚Äôt believe anyone other than 1 God (‚ÄòThe Father‚Äô) can be worshipped. At all.  BUT: That doesn‚Äôt mean Jesus isn‚Äôt a ‚ÄòCreator.‚Äô

Thus, we agree on the legitimacy of the message of Jesus.
* [13 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200413125453/https://twitter.com/Imamofpeace/status/1249681502817751041): 4- First Matter: ‚ÄòMessenger‚Äô  Muslims believe Jesus is a Messenger, not just a Prophet. A Prophet (such as Daniel) is sent by God without a Book; a Messenger (such as Moses or Jesus) comes with a book. A messenger holds a higher status than a Prophet who continues the message.

There‚Äôs no other way. Therefore my sources (evidence) need to be from the Quran and or Hadiths. This means I will not be citing the Bible, even though it is considered a Holy Book in Islam.

It‚Äôs all nonsense. If you‚Äôre tempted, go for Biotin. Vitamin H/B.  If you have ingrown hairs, infected follicles or experience bumps on your face/under your beard, see a dermatologist. This is common and temporary.  Enjoy.  End.

My beard and skin can tolerate full heat for 10 seconds. This doesn‚Äôt mean that yours can too. Hairdryers also differ.  2. Make sure that water in your beard doesn‚Äôt fall into the hairdryer when combing. Dangerous.

I move the hairdryer along with my brush, one section at a time. Temperature is usually on full hot, for no more than 10 seconds on every section. Then, I put it on cool for the final touch ups. (Spin the brush inwards).

(As a Muslim, I wash my face at least 3-4 times a day: morning shower and daily washing rituals before daily prayers) This gives my beard plenty of water and keeps it clean and hydrated. I drink a lot of water too.

Imagine Mohammad establishing Islam amongst the Romans. It just doesn‚Äôt make sense, they would have killed him‚Äî not allow him to form an army. Also,original scriptures wouldn‚Äôt have been only in Arabic. It just doesn‚Äôt add up.  18.

Fine. If the Quran says the Muslims would travel for trade, and that Mohammad was a merchant, they would need to prove who they traded with. In Mecca, we can prove who he traded with/worked for 17.

Which shows that Meccas were also surviving on hunting their food more than anything, and had to go out of the city to hunt. Not farming.  12

I‚Äôve written about this before and Muslims have disagreed. But that‚Äôs not our topic. No letter was sent or dictated by Mohammad to China and no reports were sent back from Sa‚Äôad to the Prophet.

Except that Sa‚Äôad never travelled to China. Not only because there‚Äôs no evidence for that, but because he would have sent writings to the Prophet.  4

Which means ‚ÄòMother of Villages‚Äô. ‚Äî Thus, they assumed it would be full of trees, water streams. Mecca doesn‚Äôt have that, so perhaps it‚Äôs not Mecca. Very wrong.

Can you provide those two Islamic records? - not legal. Because legal docs mean nothing in Islam.
