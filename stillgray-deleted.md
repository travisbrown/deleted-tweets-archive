The woman, who is physically weaker, becomes verbally aggressive to a domineering partner to retain her sense of agency, which he deflates through physical violence after he feels a loss of power.

She wasn’t asking for much.   It seems to me that her asking him to eat dinner was a way for her to maintain some control in a relationship in which she is physically and emotionally powerless.

And what we saw was a man beating his wife for nagging him and not thinking twice about it by doing it on camera.   From this we can infer that it is normal and habitual for him to beat her out of anger.

I can’t believe people think it’s okay to justify a man hitting his wife because he has a “breaking point.” Real men control their emotions and don’t behave like children. https://twitter.com/racismhater/status/1080765475787849728

She was fed up of the idiot playing Fortnite for hours when he said he’d have dinner and nagged him and he responded by hitting her, because it’s so normalized in that household. What happens when he isn’t streaming is likely much worse.

He does this all the time and he's smug about it. Furthermore, his "apology" is dripping with insincerity. He said he is only going to change in 2019--as if he can't change now and amend his ways.

It just means he will face no consequences for being a vile, inhumane excuse of a human being and keep doing what he's doing.

You shouldn’t use some words. But that doesn’t mean you can’t, or that you need to be prohibited from doing so.  Those with authoritarian mindsets don’t care to teach or explain virtue.

The simple (and correct) answer is that it’s politically loaded, makes you look bad, upsets people and is often used to deride others on the basis of race. It’s optics.

I was making a statement of fact that there’d be a bunch of articles written about the incident. The very premise of his rebuttal is incorrect.

It’s incredibly disappointing. I never attacked your gender or race.  You just won a prestigious gaming award and should recognize that your behavior impacts your younger, more impressionable fans.

How many of us can say we'd do what she does, even if it is for a good cause?

The cringe is strong with this one. Gotta credit her for something.

Doesn't solve the issue of them knowing where you are on the map, either. In the early game, you're gonna be scavenging. If they know where you are, they can come kill you immediately.

Stream snipers deliberately queue up to harass streamers and pursue them to their location in-game (it's a big map, after all) where they can see precisely what the streamer is doing and where he might be hiding. It's PUBG/Blackout/Fortnite. People are gonna hide.

Laura Loomer shouldn't have been banned from Twitter. 2. Laura Loomer is making a mockery of herself by chaining herself to the front door of Twitter.   They are not mutually exclusive.

Laura Loomer is creating a spectacle of herself and as clownish as her efforts are, it may help to drive the conversation about censorship on social media.

Nye should stick to rapping about gender fluidity and leave science to real scientists and visionaries. https://twitter.com/cnet/status/1064772091126403072

I’m surprised the stores took this long to act.  Tumblr is responding by removing any posts with links in it (ie legal content that followed the site guidelines) from being searchable but the illegal material remains available.

But people are gonna be people and have consciences and ties to the outside world (F76's Overseer is one example.)

The Brotherhood was founded around 2078 and they sent parties out to the east following the war, and supermutants in the East weren't the same ones created by The Master as they ran FEV testing in Vault 87.

* [18 November 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181118231241/https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/1064294790152413184): I don't agree with that. It's more Fallout than anything. They got that aspect right even if you're not a fan of how they're handling other things.
* [18 November 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181118231202/https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/1064294625123360770): The second half of Jessica Jones (s1) is where it gets good though.

It feels like a refined survival/exploration/gathering experience that I've only seen glimpses of in their previous games or in dedicated survival games that are way too punishing.
* [18 November 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181118230612/https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/1064293157393772544): Depending on where you go, you will come to a point where you realize that you have to invest effort into getting better guns and armor to overcome those harder areas. It's not very challenging if you just stick to the inner areas.
* [18 November 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181118230436/https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/1064292752228212736): So let them trash it. I don't share their opinions and my own opinion of the game isn't  going to be swayed just because someone else had reasons (legitimate or otherwise) to not like it. I'm sure I could find a million reasons not to like The Witcher 3 or RDR2.
* [18 November 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181118230349/https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/1064292553749450752): I disagree with what you said. The story and setting of Fallout 76 are its strongest aspects even if the game could use a ton of polish.

Like it's mostly done but it was clear that they needed to do more testing and bug fixing because there's some obvious parts where they forgot to set an area to a unique instance so some quests can complete properly.
* [18 November 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181118230142/https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/1064292021077037057): I'm not letting it go because some people insist on giving me shit for liking it.

I'm not paying $60 to try out Hitman 2 but I'm not gonna trash it without playing it or trash it just because I watched a YouTube video complaining about its problems.

I’m never in the mindset of wanting something to be bad, especially when I'm a fan of the series. What good does that do? I’d rather have a good time than hope for something to suck or trash it without even playing it.

Some people tried out and didn't like Fallout 76. That's fine. I don't like BF5. If you like it, that's cool. I wanted to like it but it gave me many reasons not to. But if you like it, I won't be upset with you.

The first 20 minutes gave the audience some historian that we aren't given any reason to care about before it shows us the main characters and it's all downhill from there.
* [18 November 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181118224427/https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/1064288225831747584): It's definitely shit, but read it and you'll be able to pick it apart better.

* [17 November 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181117194101/https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/1063879128988889088): As for degradation it plays into the survival aspect, which is so much better than Rust or Ark. I haven’t had any issues with it once I started crafting good weapons with tons of durability.
* [17 November 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181117194101/https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/1063879128988889088): There are definitely builds. Haven’t run into any crazy structures yet. The snapping system actually confines what you can do with it. The random perks don’t bother me—just keep leveling but don’t “level up” and wait for a good perk.

They don’t affect anything and you can get enough atoms to buy the coolest looking skin right (which you probably won’t even use because the ingame stuff looks better with your real armor) now just by playing the game for a day.
* [17 November 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181117193527/https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/1063877732755361792): There’s something weird (in a good way) about exploring a “dead” (it isn’t really) world, full of history and things that’ve happened. It’s really quite vibrant but at the same time you feel like you’re an archaeologist or an explorer unearthing the secrets of the past.
* [17 November 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181117193334/https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/1063877256768933888): I like the idea of exploring a dead world. It makes me feel like an archaeologist.

* [17 November 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181117193145/https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/1063876798553833472): I’m soloing some of it, and adventuring alone sometimes even when I’m in a party just because there’s so much to see and get distracted by.   But the best moments are when the entire party comes across some awesome looking monument in the horizon and we say “let’s go there.”
* [17 November 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181117192936/https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/1063876259879432192): The world Bethesda has crafted in West Virginia is replete with both pre- and post-war politics and lore and so much environmental storytelling that I’m just in absolute awe of how much dedication they put in designing the entire setting.
* [17 November 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181117192723/https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/1063875699231010816): It’s fun alone also.

It’s very much a Fallout game and a Bethesda game and I fucking love it.
* [17 November 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181117192415/https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/1063874913587449856): So much of the negative reception I’ve seen to Fallout 76 focuses on the abundance of very minor bugs that, after 30 hours of playing it, are negligible in comparison to the awesome experiences I’m getting out of it through the exploration and story and the coop with friends.
* [17 November 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181117133053/https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/1063785979754860544): So is dressing well and practicing good hygiene. Ban makeup I guess lmao https://twitter.com/herbertsghost/status/1063780963417800707

Humans aren’t plants.   Plenty of animals, especially birds, display vibrant coloration. And people—even from ancient times—wear vibrant clothing and dyes to show off. It’s been this way forever.
* [17 November 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181117124815/https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/1063775797914128386): What for real what about birds lol.

The color of your hair dye doesn’t define a woman any more than painting her fingernails a certain color. It’s even less than wearing a certain fashion brand.   Sure, lots of Tumblrinas adopted the look but the alt-right stole Pepe. Doesn’t mean we should surrender it. https://twitter.com/aja_cortes/status/1057366495687172096

You were basically born to die in some meaningless war for your jarl or king or you’d get killed for just being a member of someone’s family. Life was nasty, brutish and short and people today have it so good.

No one would bat an eye if it was a book or movie set in Chechnya with fictional vampires.

If you buy it you'll have a hard time finding a filled 50v50 server two weeks from now because of how low the user population actually is.   Go get BLOPS4/FO76/RDR2 instead.

It's also selling even better than Battlefield 5.

Black Ops 4's profits are higher than ever and I have no doubt their monetization system (which is very similar to Fortnite's) isn't scummy, so it looks like Activision's sticking around.

Game of the freaking year.   Fallout 76 preorders outsold Battlefield 5 by at least 2x, at least in these stores. Not bad, Todd.
